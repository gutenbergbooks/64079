THE HAPPY HUNTING-GROUNDS</h2>
</div>


<p>There is a universal saying to the effect
that it is when men are off in the wilds that
they show themselves as they really are. As
is the case with the majority of proverbs there
is much truth in it, for without the minor comforts
of life to smooth things down, and with
even the elemental necessities more or less
problematical, the inner man has an unusual
opportunity of showing himself&mdash;and he is not
always attractive. A man may be a pleasant
companion when you always meet him clad in
dry clothes, and certain of substantial meals at
regulated intervals, but the same cheery individual
may seem a very different person when
you are both on half rations, eaten cold, and
have been drenched for three days&mdash;sleeping
from utter exhaustion, cramped and wet.</p>

<p>My father had done much hunting with
many and varied friends. I have often heard
him say of some one whom I had thought an
ideal hunting companion: “He’s a good fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
but he was always fishing about in the
pot for the best piece of meat, and if there was
but one partridge shot, he would try to roast
it for himself. If there was any delicacy he
wanted more than his share.” Things assume
such different proportions in the wilds; after
two months living on palm-tree tops and
monkeys, a ten-cent can of condensed milk
bought for three dollars from a rubber explorer
far exceeds in value the greatest delicacy of
the season to the ordinary citizen who has a
varied and sufficient menu at his command
every day in the year.</p>

<p>Even as small children father held us responsible
to the law of the jungle. He would
take us out on camping trips to a neck of land
four or five miles across the bay from home.
We would row there in the afternoon, the boats
laden with blankets and food. Then we
would make a driftwood fire on which to fry
our supper&mdash;usually bacon and chicken. I
do not know whether it was the, to us, wild
romance of our position, or the keen appetite
from the row, but never since then have I
eaten such bacon. Not even the smallest
child was allowed to show a disposition to
grab, or select his pieces of chicken&mdash;we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
taught that that was an unpardonable offense
out camping, and might cause the culprit to
be left behind next time. And woe to any one
who in clumsily walking about kicked sand
into the frying-pan. After supper we would
heap more driftwood on the fire, and drape
ourselves in our blankets. Then we would
stretch ourselves out in the sand while father
would tell us ghost stories. The smallest of
us lay within reach of father where we could
touch him if the story became too vivid for
our nerves and we needed the reassuring feel
of his clothes to bring us back to reality.
There was, however, a delicious danger in being
too near him. In stories in which the
“haunt” seized his victim, father generally
illustrated the action by making a grab at
the nearest child. After the stories were finished
we rolled up in our blankets and, thoroughly
permeated with sand, we slept until the
first faint light of dawn. Then there was the
fire to be built up, and the breakfast cooked,
and the long row home. As we rowed we
chanted a ballad, usually of a seafaring nature;
it might be “The Rhyme of the Three
Sealers,” or “The Galley Slave,” or “Simon
Danz.” Father taught us these and many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
more, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i>, when he was dressing for
dinner. A child was not taken along on these
“campings out” until he was six or seven.
They took place three or four times a summer,
and continued until after the African expedition.
By that time we were most of us
away at work, scattered far and wide.</p>

<p>Father always threw himself into our plays
and romps when we were small as if he were
no older than ourselves, and with all that he
had seen and done and gone through, there was
never any one with so fresh and enthusiastic
an attitude. His wonderful versatility and
his enormous power of concentration and absorption
were unequalled. He could turn from
the consideration of the most grave problems
of state to romp with us children as if there
were not a worry in the world. Equally could
he bury himself in an exhaustive treatise on
the <cite>History of the Mongols</cite> or in the <cite>Hound
of the Baskervilles</cite>.</p>

<p>Until father sold his ranches in North Dakota
he used to go out West each year for a month
or so. Unfortunately, we were none of us
old enough to be taken along, but we would
wait eagerly for his letters, and the recipient of
what we called a picture letter gloried in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
envy of the rest until another mail placed a
substitute upon the pedestal. In these picture
letters father would sketch scenes and incidents
about the ranch or on his short hunting trips.
We read most of them to pieces, unluckily,
but the other day I came across one of the
non-picture letters that father wrote me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="padr1">August 30, ’96.</span><br />
Out on the prairie.<br />
</p>

<p>I must send my little son a letter too, for his father
loves him very much. I have just ridden into camp
on Muley,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with a prongbuck strapped behind the
saddle; I was out six hours before shooting it. Then
we all sat down on the ground in the shade of the wagon
and had dinner, and now I shall clean my gun, and then
go and take a bath in a big pool nearby, where there
is a large flat stone on the edge, so I don’t have to get
my feet muddy. I sleep in the buffalo hide bag and
I never take my clothes off when I go to bed!</p></div>

<p>By the time we were twelve or thirteen we
were encouraged to plan hunting trips in the
West. Father never had time to go with us,
but we would be sent out to some friend of his,
like Captain Seth Bullock, to spend two or
three weeks in the Black Hills, or perhaps we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
would go after duck and prairie-chicken with
Marvin Hewitt. Father would enter into all
the plans and go down with us to the range
to practise with rifle or shotgun, and when we
came back we would go over every detail of the
trip with him, revelling in his praise when he
felt that we had acquitted ourselves well.</p>

<p>Father was ever careful to correct statements
to the effect that he was a crack shot. He
would explain how little being one had to do
with success and achievement as a hunter.
Perseverance, skill in tracking, quick vision,
endurance, stamina, and a cool head, coupled
with average ability as a marksman, produced
far greater results than mere skill with a rifle&mdash;unaccompanied
to any marked extent by
the other attributes. It was the sum of all
these qualities, each above the average, but
none emphasized to an extraordinary degree,
that accounted for father’s great success in
the hunting-field. He would point out many
an excellent shot at a target who was of no use
against game. Sometimes this would be due
to lack of nerve. Father himself was equally
cool and unconcerned whether his quarry was a
charging lion or a jack-rabbit; with, when it
came to the question of scoring a hit, the resultant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
advantage in the size of the former as
a target. In other instances a good man at
the range was not so good in the field because
he was accustomed to shooting under conventional
and regulated conditions, and fell down
when it came to shooting under disadvantageous
circumstances&mdash;if he had been running
and were winded, if he were hungry or wet,
or tired, or feeling the sun, if he were uncertain
of the wind or the range. Sometimes, of
course, a crack shot possesses all the other
qualities; such is the case with Stewart Edward
White, whom Cuninghame classified as the
best shot with whom he had hunted in all his
twenty-five years in the wilds. Father shot
on a par with Cuninghame, and a good deal
better than I, though not as well as Tarleton.</p>

<p>I have often heard father regret the fact
that he did not care for shooting with the shotgun.
He pointed out that it was naturally
the most accessible and least expensive form
of hunting. His eyesight made it almost
impossible for him to attain much skill with a
shotgun, and although as a boy and young
man he went off after duck for sport, in later
years he never used a shotgun except for
collecting specimens or shooting for the pot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
He continually encouraged us to learn to shoot
with the gun. In a letter he wrote me to Europe
when I was off after chamois he said: “I
have played tennis a little with both Archie
and Quentin, and have shot with the rifle with
Archie and seen that he has practised shotgun
shooting with Seaman.”</p>

<p>When my brother and myself were ten and
eight, respectively, father took us and four of
our cousins of approximately the same ages to
the Great South Bay for a cruise, with some
fishing and bird-shooting thrown in, as the
guest of Regis Post. It was a genuine sacrifice
on father’s part, for he loathed sailing,
detested fishing, and was, to say the least, lukewarm
about bird-shooting. Rowing was the
only method of progression by water for which
he cared. The trip was a great success, however,
and father enjoyed it more than he anticipated,
for with the help of our host he instructed
us in caring for ourselves and our
firearms. I had a venerable 12-bore pin-fire
gun which was the first weapon my father ever
owned. It was usually known in the family as
the “rust bore” because in the course of its
eventful career it had become so pitted and
scarred with rust that you could put in as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
time as you wished cleaning and oiling without
the slightest effect. I stood in no little awe of
the pin-fire because of its recoil when fired, and
as I was in addition a miserably poor shot, my
bag on the Great South Bay trip was not
large. It consisted of one reedbird, which
father with infinite pains and determination
at length succeeded in enabling me to shoot.
I am sure he never spent more time and effort
on the most difficult stalk after some coveted
trophy in the West or in Africa.</p>

<p>Father’s hunting experiences had been confined
to the United States, but he had taken
especial interest in reading about Africa, the
sportsman’s paradise. When we were small he
would read us incidents from the hunting books
of Roualeyn Gordon Cumming, or Samuel
Baker, or Drummond, or Baldwin. These we
always referred to as “I stories,” because they
were told in the first person, and when we were
sent to bed we would clamor for just one more,
a petition that was seldom denied. Before
we were old enough to appreciate the adventures
we were shown the pictures, and through
Cornwallis Harris’s beautiful colored prints
in the <cite>Portraits of Game and Wild Animals of
Southern Africa</cite> we soon learned to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the great beasts of Africa. The younger
Gordon Cumming came to stay with us at
Sagamore, and when father would get him to
tell us hunting incidents from his own varied
career, we listened enthralled to a really living
“I story.” To us he was known as the “Elephant
Man,” from his prowess in the pursuit of
the giant pachyderm.</p>

<p>Then there was also the “Shark Man.”
He was an Australian who told us most thrilling
tales of encounters with sharks witnessed
when among the pearl-divers. I remember
vividly his description of seeing a shark attack
one of the natives working for him. The
man was pulled aboard only after the shark
had bitten a great chunk from his side and exposed
his heart, which they could see still
beating. He said, “Master, master, big fish,”
before he died.</p>

<p>The illustrations in Millais’s <cite>Breath from the
Veldt</cite> filled us with delight, and to this day I
know of no etching that affects me as does the
frontispiece by the author’s father. It is
called the “Last Trek.” An old hunter is lying
dead beside his ox-wagon; near him squat
two of his Kafir boys, and in the distance graze
herds of zebra and hartebeeste and giraffe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>Of the mighty hunters that still survived
at that time, father admired most Mr. F. C.
Selous. His books he knew almost by heart.
Whenever Selous came to the United States
he would stay with us, and father would sit
up till far into the night talking of wild life
in the open. Selous, at sixty-five, enlisted in
the late war as a private; he rose to be captain,
and was decorated with the D. S. O. for gallantry,
before he fell, fighting the Germans
in East Africa. No one could have devised a
more fitting end for the gallant old fellow than
to die at the head of his men, in a victorious
battle on those plains he had roamed so often
and loved so well, fighting against the worst
and most dangerous beast of his generation.</p>

<p>In 1887 father founded a hunting club
called the “Boone and Crockett” after two
of the most mighty hunters of America. No
one was entitled to membership who had not
brought down in fair chase three species of
American big game. The membership was
limited to a hundred and I well remember my
father’s pride when my brother and I qualified
and were eventually elected members. The
club interests itself particularly in the conservation
of wild life, and the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
of game refuges. Mr. Selous and other English
hunters were among the associate members.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1908 my father told me
that when his term in the White House ended
the following spring, he planned to make a
trip to Africa, and that if I wished to do so I
could accompany him. There was no need
to ask whether I wanted to go. At school
when we were writing compositions, mine almost
invariably took the form of some imaginary
journey across the “Dark Continent.”
Still, father had ever made it a practice to talk
to us as if we were contemporaries. He would
never order or even tell us to follow a certain
line; instead, he discussed it with us, and let
us draw our own conclusions. In that way we
felt that while we had his unreserved backing,
we were yet acting on our own initiative, and
were ourselves responsible for the results. If
a boy is forced to do a thing he often makes
but a half-hearted attempt to succeed, and lays
his failure to the charge of the person who
forced him, although he might well have come
through with flying colors had he felt that he
was acting on his own responsibility. In his
discussions with us, father could of course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
shape our opinions in what he thought the
proper mould.</p>

<p>In like manner, when it came to taking me
to Africa father wanted me to go, but he also
wanted me to thoroughly understand the pro’s
and con’s. He explained to me that it was a
holiday that he was allowing himself at fifty,
after a very busy life&mdash;that if I went I would
have to make up my mind that my holiday
was coming at the beginning of my life, and
be prepared to work doubly hard to justify
both him and myself for having taken it. He
said that the great danger lay in my being unsettled,
but he felt that taken rightly the experience
could be made a valuable asset instead
of a liability. After we had once finished the
discussion and settled that I was to go, father
never referred to it again. He then set about
preparing for the expedition. Mr. Edward
North Buxton was another African hunter
whom he greatly admired, and it was to him
and to Selous that he chiefly turned for aid
in making his plans. It was often said of
father that he was hasty and inclined to go
off at half-cock. There was never any one who
was less so. He would gather his information
and make his preparations with painstaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
care, and then when the moment came
to act he was thoroughly equipped and prepared
to do so with that lightning speed that
his enemies characterized as rash hot-headedness.</p>

<p>Father always claimed that it was by discounting
and guarding against all possible
causes of failure that he won his successes.
His last great battle, that for preparedness for
the part that “America the Unready” would
have to play in the World War, was true to
his life creed. For everything he laid his
plans in advance, foreseeing as far as was
humanly possible each contingency to be encountered.</p>

<p>For the African expedition he made ready
in every way. I was at the time at Harvard,
and almost every letter brought some reference
to preparations. One day it would be: “The
Winchester rifles came out for trial and all
of them were sighted wrong. I sent them
back with rather an acid letter.” Then again:
“You and I will be so rusty when we reach
Sir Alfred Pease’s ranch that our first efforts
at shooting are certain to be very bad. In
March we will practise at Oyster Bay with the
30-30 until we get what I would call the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
‘rifle sense’ back again, and this will make it
easier for us when, after a month’s sea trip, we
take up the business of hunting.”</p>

<p>A group of thirty or forty of the most famous
zoologists and sportsmen presented my father
with a heavy, double-barrelled gun. “At last
I have tried the double-barrelled Holland
Elephant rifle. It is a perfect beauty and it
shoots very accurately, but of course the recoil
is tremendous, and I fired very few shots.
I shall get you to fire it two or three times at a
target after we reach Africa, just so that you
shall be thoroughly familiar with it, if, or when,
you use it after big game. There is no question
that except under extraordinary circumstances
it would be the best weapon for elephant,
rhino, and buffalo. I think the 405
Winchester will be as good for everything
else.”</p>

<p>“About all my African things are ready now,
or will be in a few days. I suppose yours are
in good trim also [a surreptitious dig at a
somewhat lackadaisical son.] I am pursuing
my usual plan of taking all the precautions in
advance.”</p>

<p>A few days later came another reference to
the Holland &amp; Holland: “The double-barrelled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
four-fifty shot beautifully, but I was
paralyzed at the directions which accompanied
it to the effect that two shots must always be
fired in the morning before starting, as otherwise
from the freshly oiled barrels the first
shot would go high. This is all nonsense and
I shall simply have to see that the barrels are
clean of the oil.” The recoil of the big gun
was so severe that it became a standing joke
as to whether we did not fear it more than a
charging elephant!</p>

<p>Father gave the closest attention to every
detail of the equipment. The first provision
lists prepared by his friends in England were
drawn up on a presidential scale with champagne
and pâté de foies gras and all sorts of
luxuries. These were blue-pencilled and two
American staples substituted&mdash;baked beans
and canned tomatoes. Father always retained
the appreciation of canned tomatoes gained in
the early ranching days in the West. He would
explain how delicious he had found it in the
Bad Lands after eating the tomatoes to drink
the juice from the can. In hunting in a temperate
climate such as our West, a man can
get along with but very little, and it is difficult
to realize that a certain amount of luxury is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
necessary in the tropics to maintain oneself
fit. Then, too, in Africa the question of transportation
was fairly simple&mdash;and almost everywhere
we were able to keep ourselves and the
porters amply supplied with fresh meat. Four
years later during the descent of the Dúvida&mdash;the
“River of Doubt”&mdash;we learned to our bitter
cost what it meant to travel in the tropics as
lightly equipped as one could, with but little
hardship, in the north. It was not, however,
through our own lack of forethought, but due
rather to the necessities and shifting chances
of a difficult and dangerous exploring expedition.</p>

<p>Even if it is true as Napoleon said, that an
army marches on its belly, still, it won’t go far
unless its feet are properly shod, and since my
father had a skin as tender as a baby’s, he
took every precaution that his boots should
fit him properly and not rub. “The modified
duffle-bags came all right. I suppose we will
get the cotton-soled shoes, but I do not know.
How do you like the rubber-soled shoes?
Don’t you think before ordering other pairs
it would be as well to wait until you see the
army shoes here, which are light and somehow
look as if they were more the kind you ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
use? How many pairs have you now
for the African trip, and how many more do
you think you want?”</p>

<p>Father was fifty years old in the October before
we left for Africa, and the varied experiences
of his vigorous life had, as he used to
say, battered and chipped him. One eye was
to all intents useless from the effects of a
boxing-match, and from birth he had been so
astigmatic as to be absolutely unable to use a
rifle and almost unable to find his way in the
woods without his glasses. He never went off
without eight or ten pairs so distributed
throughout his kit as to minimize the possibility
of being crippled through any ordinary
accident. Even so, any one who has worn
glasses in the tropics knows how easily they
fog over, and how hopeless they are in the
rains. It was a continual source of amazement
to see how skilfully father had discounted this
handicap in advance and appeared to be unhampered
by it.</p>

<p>Another serious threat lay in the leg that
had been injured when the carriage in which
he was driving was run down by a trolley-car,
and the secret service man with him was
killed. In September, 1908, he wrote me from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Washington: “I have never gotten over the
effects of the trolley-car accident six years ago,
when, as you will remember, they had to cut
down to the shin bone. The shock permanently
damaged the bone, and if anything
happens there is always a chance of trouble
which would be serious. Before I left Oyster
Bay, while riding, I got a rap on the shin
bone from a branch. This was either the cause
or the occasion of an inflammation, which had
grown so serious when I got back here that
Doctor Rixey had to hastily take it in hand.
For a couple of days it was uncertain whether
we would not have to have another operation
and remove some of the bones of the leg, but
fortunately the doctor got it in hand all right,
and moreover it has enabled me to learn just
what I ought to do if I am threatened with
similar trouble in Africa.”</p>

<p>His activity, however, was little hampered
by his leg, for a few weeks later he wrote:
“I have done very little jumping myself, and
that only of the small jumps up to four feet,
because it is evident that I have got to be
pretty careful of my leg, and that an accident
of at all a serious character might throw me
out of gear for the African trip. This afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
by the way, Archie Butt and I took a
scramble down Rock Creek. It was raining
and the rocks were slippery, and at one point
I slipped off into the creek, but merely bruised
myself in entirely safe places, not hurting my
leg at all. When we came to the final and
stiffest cliff climb, it was so dark that Archie
couldn’t get up.” From which it may be
seen that neither endurance nor skill suffered
as a result of the accident to the leg. Still, as
Bret Harte says, “We always wink with the
weaker eye,” and when anything went wrong,
the leg was sure to be implicated. Father
suffered fearfully with it during the descent
of the River of Doubt. One of the most constant
pictures of father that I retain is at Sagamore
after dinner on the piazza. He would
draw his chair out from the roofed-over part
to where he could see the moon and the
stars. When things were black he would often
quote Jasper Petulengro in Borrow’s <cite>Lavengro</cite>:
“Life is sweet, brother.... There’s day and
night, brother, both sweet things; sun, moon,
and stars, all sweet things; ... and likewise
there’s a wind on the heath,” and would add:
“Yes, there’s always the wind on the heath.”
From where he sat he looked across the fields<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to the dark woods, and over the tree-tops to
the bay with the changing twinkling lights of
the small craft; across the bay to the string
of lamps along the causeway leading to Centre
Island, and beyond that again Long Island
Sound with occasionally a “tall Fall Steamer
light.” For a while father would drink his
coffee in silence, and then his rocking-chair
would start creaking and he would say: “Do
you remember that night in the Sotik when
the gun-bearers were skinning the big lion?”
or “What a lovely camp that was under the
big tree in the Lado when we were hunting the
giant eland?”</p>

<p>We get three sorts and periods of enjoyment
out of a hunting trip. The first is when the
plans are being discussed and the outfit assembled;
this is the pleasure of anticipation. The
second is the enjoyment of the actual trip itself;
and the third is the pleasure of retrospection
when we sit round a blazing wood-fire
and talk over the incidents and adventures of
the trip. There is no general rule to know
which of the three gives the keenest joy. I
can think of a different expedition in which
each sort stands out in pre-eminence. Even
if the trip has been exceptionally hard and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
luck unusually bad, the pleasures of anticipation
and preparation cannot be taken away,
and frequently the retrospect is the more satisfactory
because of the difficulties and discomforts
surmounted.</p>

<p>I think we enjoyed the African trip most in
the actuality, and that is saying a great deal.
It was a wonderful “adventure” and all the
world seemed young. Father has quoted in the
foreword to <cite>African Game Trails</cite>: “I speak
of Africa and golden joys.” It was a line
that I have heard him repeat to himself many
times. In Africa everything was new. He
revelled in the vast plains blackened with herds
of grazing antelope. From his exhaustive
reading and retentive memory he knew already
the history and the habits of the different
species of game. When we left camp
in the early morning we never could foretell
what we would run into by nightfall&mdash;we were
prepared for anything from an elephant to
a dik-dik&mdash;the graceful diminutive antelope
no larger than a hare. In the evening, after
we had eaten we would gather round the camp-fire&mdash;for
in the highlands the evenings were
chilly&mdash;and each would tell the adventures of
his day, and discuss plans for the morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Then we would start paralleling and comparing.
Father would illustrate with adventures
of the old days in our West; Cuninghame
from the lore gathered during his twenty years
in Africa would relate some anecdote, and
Mearns would talk of life among the wild
tribes in the Philippines.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp97" id="i024fp" style="max-width: 81.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_024fp.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Sir Alfred Pease’s sketch of our first giraffe hunt</div>
</div>

<p>Colonel Mearns belonged to the medical
corps in the army. He had come with us as
an ornithologist, for throughout his military
career he had been actively interested in sending
specimens from wherever he was serving
to the Smithsonian National Museum in Washington.
His mild manner belied his fearless
and intrepid disposition. A member of the
expedition once came into camp with an account
of the doctor, whom he had just run
across&mdash;looking too benevolent for this world,
engaged in what our companion described as
“slaughtering humming-birds, pursuing them
from bush to bush.” One of his Philippine
adventures filled us with a delighted interest
for which I don’t believe he fully appreciated
the reason. He told us how with a small force
he had been hemmed in by a large number of
Moros. The Americans took refuge in a
stockade on a hilltop. The Moros advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
time and again with the greatest gallantry,
and Mearns explained how sorry he felt for
them as they fell&mdash;some under the very walls
of the stockade. In a musing tone at the
end he added: “I slipped out of the stockade
that night and collected a most interesting
series of skulls; they’re in the Smithsonian
to-day.”</p>

<p>Father was the rare combination of a born
raconteur&mdash;with the gift of putting in all the
little details that make a story&mdash;and an equally
good listener. He was an adept at drawing
people out. His interest was so whole-hearted
and obvious that the shyest, most tongue-tied
adventurer found himself speaking with
entire freedom. Every one with whom we came
in contact fell under the charm. Father invariably
thought the best of a person, and for
that very reason every one was at his best with
him&mdash;and felt bound to justify his confidence
and judgment. With him I always thought
of the Scotch story of the MacGregor who,
when a friend told him that it was an outrage
that at a certain banquet he should have been
given a seat half-way down the table, replied:
“Where the MacGregor sits is the head of the
table!” Where father sat was always the head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of the table, and yet he treated every one with
the same courtesy and simplicity, whether it
was the governor of the Protectorate or the
poorest Boer settler. I remember how amazed
some were at the lack of formality in his relationship
with the members of the expedition.
Many people who have held high positions
feel it incumbent on them to maintain a certain
distance in their dealings with their less
illustrious fellow men. If they let down the
barrier they feel, they would lose dignity.
They are generally right, for their superiority
is not innate, but the result of chance. With
father it was otherwise. The respect and
consideration felt for him could not have been
greater, and would certainly not have been
so sincere, had he built a seven-foot barrier
about himself.</p>

<p>He was most essentially unselfish, and wanted
no more than would have been his just due if
the expedition, instead of being owing entirely
to him, both financially and otherwise, had
been planned and carried out by all of us.
He was a natural champion of the cause of
every man, and not only in his books would he
carefully give credit where it was due, but he
would endeavor to bring about recognition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
through outside channels. Thus he felt that
Colonel Rondon deserved wide acknowledgment
for the years of exploring in the Brazilian
Hinterland; and he brought it to the attention
of the American and British Geographical
Societies. As a result, the former awarded
the gold medal to Colonel Rondon. In the
same way father championed the cause of
the naturalists who went with him on his expeditions.
He did his best to see that the
museums to which they belonged should appreciate
their services, and give them the opportunity
to follow the results through. When
an expedition brings back material that has
not been described, the museum publishes
pamphlets listing the new species, and explaining
their habitats and characteristics. This
is rarely done by the man who did the actual
collecting. Father, whenever it was feasible,
arranged for the naturalists who had accompanied
or taken part in the collecting to have
the credit of writing the pamphlets describing
the results of their work. To a layman this
would not seem much, but in reality it means
a great deal. Father did all he could to encourage
his companions to write their experiences,
for most of them had led eventful lives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
filled with unusual incident. When, as is
often the case, the actor did not have the power
of written narrative, father would be the first
to recognize it, and knew that if inadequately
described, the most eventful careers may be
of no more interest than the catalogue of ships
in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, or the “begat” chapters in the
Bible. If, however, father felt that there existed
a genuine ability to write, he would spare
no efforts to place the articles; in some cases
he would write introductions, and in others,
reviews of the book, if the results attained to
that proportion.</p>

<p>One of the most careful preparations that
father made for the African expedition was
the choosing of the library. He selected as
wide a range as possible, getting the smallest
copy of each book that was obtainable with
decent reading type. He wanted a certain
number of volumes mainly for the contrast
to the daily life. He told me that he had
particularly enjoyed Swinburne and Shelley
in ranching days in the Bad Lands, because
they were so totally foreign to the life and the
country&mdash;and supplied an excellent antidote
to the daily round. Father read so rapidly
that he had to plan very carefully in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
have enough books to last him through a
trip. He liked to have a mixture of serious
and light literature&mdash;chaff, as he called the
latter. When he had been reading histories
and scientific discussions and political treatises
for a certain length of time, he would plunge
into an orgy of detective stories and novels
about people cast away on desert islands.</p>

<p>The plans for the Brazilian expedition came
into being so unexpectedly that he could
not choose his library with the usual care.
He brought Gibbon’s <cite>Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire</cite> in the Everyman’s edition,
and farmed out a volume to each of us, and
most satisfactory it proved to all. He also
brought <cite>Marcus Aurelius</cite> and <cite>Epictetus</cite>, but
when he tried to read them during the descent
of the Rio da Dúvida, they only served to fill
him with indignation at their futility. Some
translations of Greek plays, not those of Gilbert
Murray, for which he had unstinted praise,
met with but little better success, and we were
nearly as badly off for reading matter as we
were for provisions. I had brought along a
selection of Portuguese classics and a number
of French novels. The former were useless
to father, but Henri Bordeaux and Maurice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Leblanc were grist to the mill. It was father’s
first introduction to Arsène, and he thoroughly
enjoyed it&mdash;he liked the style, although for
matter he preferred Conan Doyle. Father
never cared very much about French novels&mdash;the
French books that he read most were
scientific volumes&mdash;histories of the Mongols&mdash;and
an occasional hunting book, but he afterward
became a great admirer of Henri Bordeaux.</p>

<p>At last the time came when there was
nothing left but the Oxford books of English
and French verse. The one of English verse
he had always disliked. He said that if there
were to be any American poetry included, it
should be at any rate a good selection. The
choice from Longfellow’s poems appealed to
him as particularly poor, and I think that it
was for this reason that he disapproved of the
whole collection. Be that as it may, I realized
how hard up for something to read father must
be when he asked me for my Oxford book of
English verse. For French verse father had
never cared. He said it didn’t sing sufficiently.
“The Song of Roland” was the one exception
he granted. It was, therefore, a still greater
proof of distress when he borrowed the Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
book of French verse. He always loved to
tell afterward that when he first borrowed it
he started criticising and I had threatened to
take it away if he continued to assail my
favorites. In spite of all this he found it infinitely
preferable to <cite>Epictetus</cite> and <cite>Marcus
Aurelius</cite>, and, indeed, became very fond of
some of the selections. Villon and Ronsard
particularly interested him.</p>

<p>When riding along through the wilderness
father would often repeat poetry to himself.
To learn a poem he had only to read it through
a few times, and he seemed never to forget
it. Sometimes we would repeat the poem together.
It might be parts of the “Saga of King
Olaf,” or Kipling’s “Rhyme of the Three
Sealers,” or “Grave of a Hundred Head,” or,
perhaps, “The Bell Buoy”&mdash;or again it might
be something from Swinburne or Shelley or
Keats&mdash;or the “Ballad of Judas Iscariot.” He
was above all fond of the poetry of the open,
and I think we children got much of our love
for the outdoor life, not only from actual example,
but from the poetry that father taught
us.</p>

<p>There was an indissoluble bond between
him and any of his old hunting companions,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and in no matter what part of the world he
met them, all else was temporarily forgotten
in the eager exchange of reminiscences of old
days. On the return from Africa, Seth Bullock,
of Deadwood, met us in London. How
delighted father was to see him, and how he
enjoyed the captain’s comments on England
and things English! One of the captain’s first
remarks on reaching London was to the effect
that he was so glad to see father that he
felt like hanging his hat on the dome of Saint
Paul’s and shooting it off. We were reminded
of Artemus Ward’s classic reply to the guard
who found him tapping, with his cane, an inscription
in Westminster Abbey: “Come,
come, sir, you mustn’t do that. It isn’t permitted,
you know!” Whereupon Artemus
Ward turned upon him: “What, mustn’t do
it? If I like it, I’ll buy it!” It was never
difficult to trail the captain. When my sister
and I were going through Edinburgh Castle,
the local guide showed us an ancient gun,
firing a cluster of five or six barrels. With
great amusement he told us how an American
to whom he was showing the piece a few days
previously had remarked that to be shot at
with that gun must be like taking a shower-bath.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
A few questions served to justify the
conclusion we had immediately formed as to
the identity of our predecessor. Father had
him invited to the dinner given by the donors
of the Holland &amp; Holland elephant rifle.</p>

<p>Of the hunting comrades of his early days,
he told me that Mr. R. H. Munro Ferguson
was the most satisfactory of all, for he met
all requirements&mdash;always good-humored when
things went wrong, possessing a keen sense of
humor, understanding the value of silent companionship,
and so well read and informed as
to be able to discuss appreciatively any of the
multitudinous questions of literature or world
affairs that interested my father.</p>

<p>In Washington when an old companion
turned up he would be triumphantly borne off
to lunch, to find himself surrounded by famous
scientists, authors, senators, and foreign diplomats.
Father would shift with lightning rapidity
from one to the other&mdash;first he might
be discussing some question of Indian policy
and administration, next the attitude of a
foreign power&mdash;then an author’s latest novel&mdash;and
a few moments later, he would have led
on Johnny Goff to telling an experience with
the cougar hounds.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Any man who had hunted with father was
ready to follow him to the ends of the earth,
and no passage of time could diminish his
loyalty. With father the personal equation
counted for so much. He was so whole-heartedly
interested in his companions&mdash;in
their aspirations and achievements. In every
detail he was keenly interested, and he would
select from his library those volumes which
he thought would most interest each companion,
and, perhaps, develop in him the love
of the wonderful avocation which he himself
found in reading. His efforts were not always
crowned with success. Father felt that
our African companion, R. J. Cuninghame, the
“Bearded Master,” as the natives called him,
being Scotch should be interested in Scott’s
novels, so he selected from the “Pigskin Library”
a copy of one of them&mdash;<cite>Waverley</cite>, I
think it was. For some weeks Cuninghame
made progress, not rapid, it is true, for he
confessed to finding the notes the most interesting
part of the book, then one day when
they were sitting under a tree together in a
rest during the noonday heat, and father in
accordance with his invariable custom took out
a book from his saddle-pocket, R. J. produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
<cite>Waverley</cite> and started industriously to work on
it. Father looked over his shoulder to see
where he had got to, and to his amused delight
found that Cuninghame had been losing
ground&mdash;he was three chapters farther back
than he had been two weeks before!</p>

<p>We more than once had occasion to realize
how largely the setting is responsible for much
that we enjoy in the wilds. Father had told
me of how he used to describe the bellowing
of the bull elk as he would hear it ring out in
the frozen stillness of the forests of Wyoming.
He thought of it, and talked of it, as a weird,
romantic call&mdash;until one day when he was
walking through the zoological gardens accompanied
by the very person to whom he had
so often given the description. As they passed
the wapitis’ enclosure, a bull bellowed, and
father’s illusions and credit were simultaneously
shattered, for the romantic call he had
so often dwelt upon was, in a zoological park,
nothing more than a loud and discordant sort
of bray.</p>

<p>In spite of this lesson we would see something
among the natives that was interesting
or unusual and get it to bring home, only to
find that it was the exotic surroundings that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
had been responsible for a totally fictitious
charm. A wild hill tribe in Africa use anklets
made from the skin of the colobus, a graceful,
long-haired monkey colored black and white.
When father produced the anklets at home,
the only thing really noticeable about them
was the fact that they smelt!</p>

<p>Another equally unfortunate case was the
affair of the beehives. The same hill tribe
was very partial to honey. An individual’s
wealth was computed in the number of beehives
that he possessed. They were made
out of hollowed logs three or four feet long
and eight or ten inches in diameter. A wife
or a cow was bought for an agreed upon number
of beehives, and when we were hunting, no
matter how hot the trail might be, the native
tracker would, if we came to a clearing and
saw some bees hovering about the forest flowers,
halt and offer up a prayer that the bees
should deposit the honey in one of his hives.
It seemed natural to bring a hive home, but
viewed in the uncompromising light of the
North Shore of Long Island it was merely a
characterless, uninteresting log.</p>

<p>Not the least of the many delights of being
a hunting companion of father’s was his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
humor. No one could tell a better story,
whether it was what he used to call one of
his “old grouse in the gunroom” stories, or
an account, with sidelights, of a contemporaneous
adventure. The former had to do
with incidents in his early career in the cow-camps
of the Dakotas, or later on with the
regiment in Cuba&mdash;and phrases and incidents
of them soon became coin-current in the expedition.
Father’s humor was never under
any circumstances ill-natured, or of such a
sort as might make its object feel uncomfortable.
If anything amusing occurred to a member
of the expedition, father would embroider
the happening in inimitable fashion, but always
in such a way that the victim himself was
the person most amused. The accompanying
drawing will serve as illustration. Father and
I had gone out to get some buck to eke out the
food-supply for the porters. We separated,
but some time later I caught sight of father
and thought I would join him and return to
camp. I didn’t pay particular attention to
what he was doing, and as he was some way
off I failed to notice that he was walking
stooped to keep concealed by a rise of ground
from some buck he was stalking. The result
was the picture.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Before we started on the serious exploring
part of the Brazilian trip, we paid visits to
several fazendas or ranches in the state of
Matto Grosso, with the purpose of hunting
jaguar, as well as the lesser game of the country.
One of the fazendas at which we stayed
belonged to the governor of the state. When
we were wakened before daylight to start off
on the hunt we were given, in Brazilian fashion,
the small cup of black coffee and piece of bread
which constitutes the native Brazilian breakfast.
We would then sally forth to return
to the ranch not before noon, and sometimes
much later, as the hunting luck dictated.
We would find an enormous lunch waiting for
us at the house. Father, who was accustomed
to an American breakfast, remarked regretfully
that he wished the lunch were divided,
or that at least part of it were used to supplement
the black coffee of daybreak. The second
morning, as I went down the hall, the
dining-room door was ajar, and I caught sight
of the table laden with the cold meats and
salads that were to serve as part of our elaborate
luncheon many dim hours hence. I
hurried back to tell father, and we tiptoed
cautiously into the dining-room, closing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
door noiselessly behind us. While we were
engaged in making rapid despatch of a cold
chicken, we heard our hosts calling, and the
next minute the head of the house popped in
the door! As father said afterward, we felt
and looked like two small boys caught stealing
jam in the pantry.</p>

<p>The Brazilian exploration was not so carefully
planned as the African trip, because
father had not intended to make much of an
expedition. The first time he mentioned the
idea was in April, 1913, in reply to a letter I
wrote from São Paulo describing a short hunting
expedition that I had made. “The forest
must be lovely; some time I must get down to
see you, and we’ll take a fortnight’s outing,
and you shall hunt and I’ll act as what in the
North Woods we used to call ‘Wangan man,’
and keep camp!”</p>

<p>Four months later he wrote that he was
planning to come down and see me; that he
had been asked to make addresses in Brazil,
Argentina, and Chile, and “I shall take a
naturalist with me, if, as I hope, I return via
Paraguay and the Amazon.” At the time it
did not look as if it would be possible for me to
go on the trip. In father’s next letter he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
that after he left me, “instead of returning in
the ordinary tourist Bryan-Bryce-way, I am
going to see if it is possible to work across from
the Plata into the valley of the Amazon, and
come out through the Brazilian forest. This
may not be possible. It won’t be anything like
our African trip. There will be no hunting
and no adventures, so that I shall not have the
pang I otherwise would about not taking you
along.” These plans were amplified and extended
a certain amount, but in the last letter
I received they didn’t include a very serious
expedition.</p>

<p>“I shall take the Springfield and the Fox
on my trip, but I shall not expect to do any
game-shooting. I think it would need the
Bwana Merodadi, [My name among the natives
in Africa] and not his stout and rheumatic
elderly parent to do hunting in the Brazilian
forest. I shall have a couple of naturalists
with me of the Heller stamp, and I shall hope
to get a fair collection for the New York
Museum&mdash;Fairfield Osborn’s museum.”</p>

<p>It was at Rio that father first heard of the
River of Doubt. Colonel Rondon in an exploring
expedition had crossed a large river
and no one knew where it went to. Father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
felt that to build dugouts and descend the
river offered a chance to accomplish some genuine
and interesting exploration. It was more
of a trip than he had planned for, but the
Brazilian Government arranged for Colonel
Rondon to make up an accompanying expedition.</p>

<p>When father went off into the wilds he was
apt to be worried until he had done something
which would in his mind justify the expedition
and relieve it from the danger of being
a fiasco. In Africa he wished to get at least
one specimen each of the four great prizes&mdash;the
lion, the elephant, the buffalo, and the
rhinoceros. It was the lion for which he was
most keen&mdash;and which he also felt was the
most problematical. Luck was with us, and
we had not been hunting many days before
father’s ambition was fulfilled. It was something
that he had long desired&mdash;indeed it is
the pinnacle of most hunters’ ambitions&mdash;so
it was a happy cavalcade that rode back to
camp in the wake of the natives that were
carrying the lioness slung on a long pole.
The blacks were chanting a native song of
triumph, and father was singing “Whack-fa-lal
for Lannigan’s Ball,” as a sort of “chant pagan.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Father was more fluent than exact in expressing
himself in foreign languages. As he
himself said of his French, he spoke it “as if
it were a non-Aryan tongue, having neither gender
nor tense.” He would, however, always
manage to make himself understood, and never
seemed to experience any difficulty in understanding
his interlocutor. In Africa he had
a most complicated combination of sign-language
and coined words, and though I could
rarely make out what he and his gun-bearer
were talking about, they never appeared to
have any difficulty in understanding each other.
Father could read Spanish, and he had not
been in Brazil long before he could make out
the trend of any conversation in Portuguese.
With the Brazilians he always spoke French,
or, on rare occasions, German.</p>

<p>He was most conscientious about his writing.
Almost every day when he came in from hunting
he would settle down to work on the articles
that were from time to time sent back to
<cite>Scribner’s</cite>. This daily task was far more
onerous than any one who has not tried it
can imagine. When you come in from a long
day’s tramping, you feel most uninclined to
concentrate on writing a careful and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
account of the day’s activities. Father
was invariably good-humored about it, saying
that he was paying for his fun. In Brazil
when the mosquitoes and sand-flies were intolerable,
he used to be forced to write swathed
in a mosquito veil and with long gauntlets to
protect hands and wrists.</p>

<p>During the descent of the River of Doubt in
Brazil there were many black moments. It
was impossible to hazard a guess within a
month or more as to when we would get through
to the Amazon. We had dugout canoes,
and when we came to serious rapids or waterfalls
we were forced to cut a trail around to
the quiet water below. Then we must make
a corduroy road with the trunks of trees over
which to haul the dugouts. All this took a
long time, and in some places where the river
ran through gorges it was almost impossible.
We lost in all six of the ten canoes with which
we started, and of course much of our food-supply
and general equipment. It was necessary
to delay and build two more canoes&mdash;a
doubly laborious task because of the axes
and adzes which had gone down in the shipwrecks.
The Brazil nuts upon which we had
been counting to help out our food-supply had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
had an off year. If this had not been so we
would have fared by no means badly, for these
nuts may be ground into flour or roasted or
prepared in a number of different ways. Another
source upon which we counted failed
us when we found that there were scarcely
any fish in the river. For some inexplicable
reason many of the tributaries of the Amazon
teem with fish, while others flowing through
similar country and under parallel conditions
contain practically none. We went first onto
half rations, and then were forced to still
further reduce the issue. We had only the
clothes in which we stood and were wet all
day and slept wet throughout the night.
There would be a heavy downpour, then out
would come the sun and we would be steamed
dry, only to be drenched once more a half-hour
later.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i044fp" style="max-width: 97.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_044fp.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Launching a newly made dugout on the Dúvida</div>
</div>

<p>Working waist-deep in the water in an attempt
to dislodge a canoe that had been thrown
upon some rocks out in the stream, father
slipped, and, of course, it was his weak leg that
suffered. Then he came down with fever, and
in his weakened condition was attacked with
a veritable plague of deep abscesses. It can
be readily understood that the entourage and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
environment were about as unsuitable for a
sick man as any that could be imagined. Nothing
but father’s indomitable spirit brought
him through. He was not to be downed by
anything, although he knew well that the
chances were against his coming out. He
made up his mind that as long as he could, he
would go along, but that once he could no
longer travel, and held up the expedition, he
would arrange for us to go on without him.
Of course he did not at the time tell us this,
but he reasoned that with our very limited
supply of provisions, and the impossibility of
living on the country, if the expedition halted
it would not only be of no avail as far as he
was concerned, but the chances would be
strongly in favor of no one coming through.
With it all he was invariably cheerful, and in
the blackest times ever ready with a joke.
Sick as he was, he gave no one any trouble.
He would walk slowly over the portages, resting
every little while, and when the fever was
not too severe we would, when we reached the
farther end with the canoes, find him sitting
propped against a tree reading a volume of
Gibbon, or perhaps the Oxford book of verse.</p>

<p>There was one particularly black night;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
one of our best men had been shot and killed
by a useless devil who escaped into the jungle,
where he was undoubtedly killed by the Indians.
We had been working through a series
of rapids that seemed interminable. There
would be a long carry, a mile or so clear going,
and then more rapids. The fever was
high and father was out of his head. Doctor
Cajazeira, who was one of the three Brazilians
with us, divided with me the watch during the
night. The scene is vivid before me. The
black rushing river with the great trees towering
high above along the bank; the sodden
earth under foot; for a few moments the stars
would be shining, and then the sky would
cloud over and the rain would fall in torrents,
shutting out sky and trees and river. Father
first began with poetry; over and over again
he repeated “In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a
stately pleasure dome decree,” then he started
talking at random, but gradually he centred
down to the question of supplies, which was, of
course, occupying every one’s mind. Part of
the time he knew that I was there, and he
would then ask me if I thought Cherrie had
had enough to eat to keep going. Then he
would forget my presence and keep saying to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
himself: “I can’t work now, so I don’t need
much food, but he and Cherrie have worked
all day with the canoes, they must have part
of mine.” Then he would again realize my
presence and question me as to just how much
Cherrie had had. How good faithful Cajazeira
waked I do not know, but when his
watch was due I felt him tap me on the shoulder,
and crawled into my soggy hammock to
sleep the sleep of the dead.</p>

<p>Father’s courage was an inspiration never to
be forgotten by any of us; without a murmur
he would lie while Cajazeira lanced and drained
the abscesses. When we got down beyond
the rapids the river widened so that instead of
seeing the sun through the canyon of the trees
for but a few hours each day, it hung above us
all the day like a molten ball and broiled us
as if the river were a grid on which we were
made fast. To a sick man it must have been
intolerable.</p>

<p>It is when one is sick that one really longs
for home. Lying in a hammock all unwashed
and unshaven, suffocating beneath a mosquito-net,
or tortured by mosquitoes and sand-flies
when one raises the net to let in a breath
of air&mdash;it is then that one dreams of clean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
pajamas and cool sheets and iced water. I
have often heard father say when he was
having a bout of fever at home, that it was
almost a pleasure to be ill, particularly when
you thought of all the past discomforts of
fever in the wilds.</p>

<p>Father’s disappointment at not being able to
take a physical part in the war&mdash;as he has
said, “to pay with his body for his soul’s desire”&mdash;was
bitter. Strongly as he felt about
going, I doubt if his disappointment was much
more keen than that of the British and French
statesmen and generals, who so readily realized
what his presence would mean to the Allied
cause, and more than once requested in Washington
that he be sent. Marshal Joffre made
such a request in person, meeting with the
usual evasive reply. Father took his disappointment
as he had taken many another in
his life, without letting it harm his usefulness,
or discourage his aggressive energy. “In the
fell clutch of circumstance he did not wince
or cry aloud.” Indeed, the whole of Henley’s
poem might well apply to father if it were
possible to eliminate from it the unfortunate
marring undercurrent of braggadocio with
which father’s attitude was never for an instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
tinged. With the indomitable courage
that knew no deterrent he continued to fight
his battle on this side to make America’s
entry no empty action, as it threatened to be.
He wrote me that he had hoped that I would
be with him in this greatest adventure of all,
but that since it was not to be, he could only
be thankful that his four boys were permitted
to do their part in the actual fighting.</p>

<p>When in a little town in Germany my brother
and I got news of my father’s death, there kept
running through my head with monotonous
insistency Kipling’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“He scarce had need to doff his pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or slough the dress of earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E’en as he trod that day to God</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So walked he from his birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In simpleness and gentleness and honor and clean mirth.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That was my father, to whose comradeship
and guidance so many of us look forward in
the Happy Hunting-Grounds.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II<br />
IN QUEST OF SABLE ANTELOPE</h2>


<p>It was a bright, sunny day toward the end
of October, and I was walking along the streets
of the old Portuguese town of Mombasa on the
east coast of Equatorial Africa. Behind me,
in ragged formation, marched some twenty-five
blacks, all but four of them with loads
on their heads; the four were my personal
“boys,” two gun-bearers, a cook, and a tent-boy.
They were scattered among the crowd,
hurrying up those that tried to lag behind
for a last farewell to the wives and sweethearts
who were following along on either side, clad
in the dark-blue or more gaudily colored sheets
that served them for clothes.</p>

<p>At length our heterogeneous assembly
reached the white sands of the harbor, and
amid much confusion we stowed away into a
couple of long, broad dugouts and were ferried
out to a dhow that lay moored not far from the
shore. We set sail amid the shrill cries of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
women and a crowd of small children who, on
our approach, had scurried out of the water
like so many black monitor lizards.</p>

<p>We steered out across the bay toward a
headland some two miles distant. There was
just enough breeze to ruffle the water, but the
dhow sped along at a rate that belied appearances.
Sprawling among their loads the men
lit cigarettes and chatted and joked, talking
of the prospects of the trip, or the recent gossip
of Mombasa. The sailors, not knowing that
I understood Swahili, began to discuss me
in loud tones. An awkward silence fell upon
the porters, who didn’t quite know how to
tell them. Mali, my tent-boy, who was
sitting near me, looked toward me and smiled.
When the discussion became a little too personal,
I turned to him and made a few pertinent
remarks about the crew. The porters
grinned delightedly, and rarely have I seen
more shamefaced men than those sailors.</p>

<p>In far too short a time for all of us the dhow
grounded on the other side and we jumped
out and started to unload. A giant baobab-tree
stood near the beach; a cluster of huts
beneath it were occupied by some Swahilis
who fished, and ran a small store, where my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
porters laid in a final supply of delicacies&mdash;sugar
and tobacco.</p>

<p>It is customary to have a native head man,
but on this short trip I had decided to do without
one, for though the porters were new, my
personal boys were old friends. Accordingly,
when all the loads were ready and neatly arranged
in line, I shouted “Bandika!” Great
muscular black arms caught the packs and
swung them up into place on the head, and off
we started, along the old coast trail, worn deep
with the traffic of centuries, and leading on
for several hundred miles with native villages
strung along its length. Behind me strode
my two gun boys, then came the porters, all
in single file, their present regular order a
strong contrast with our disordered progress
through the streets of Mombasa. Mali and
Kombo, the cook, brought up the rear to look
out for stragglers, and help unfortunates to
rearrange their loads more comfortably.</p>

<p>A little way from the shore we passed an
old Arab well; some women were drawing
water from it, but at our approach they deserted
their earthen jars and hurried away
with shrill ejaculations. Fresh from the more
arid interior, I imagined that the men would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
fill their gourds, but they filed past without
stopping, for this was a land of many streams.</p>

<p>We continued on our way silently, now
through stretches of sandy land covered with
stunted bushes, now through native shambas,
or cultivated fields, until we came upon a
group of natives seated under a gigantic wide-spreading
tree. It was a roadside shop, and
the porters threw down their loads and shouldered
their way to where the shopkeeper was
squatting behind his wares&mdash;nuts, tobacco,
tea, bits of brass wire, beads, and sweetmeats
of a somewhat gruesome appearance.
He was a striking-looking old fellow with a
short gray beard. Pretty soon he came to
where I was sitting with a measure of nuts
for the white man; so in return I took out
my tobacco-pouch and presented him with
some of the white man’s tobacco.</p>

<p>After a few minutes’ rest we set out again
and marched along for some time until we
came to a cocoanut-palm grove, where I decided
to camp for the night. The natives we
were among were called the WaNyika&mdash;the
“children of the wilderness.”</p>

<p>Leaving the men to arrange camp under
the supervision of the gun-bearers, I strolled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
over to a nearby village where there was a
dance in full swing. The men were regaling
themselves with cocoanut-wine, an evil-tasting
liquid, made from fermented cocoanut-milk,
they told me. The moon, almost at
full, was rising when I returned to camp, and
after supper I sat and smoked and watched
“the night and the palms in the moonlight,”
until the local chief, or Sultani, as they called
him, came up and presented me with some
ripe cocoanuts, and sitting down on the ground
beside me he puffed away at his long clay
pipe, coughing and choking over the strong
tobacco I had given him, but apparently enjoying
it all immensely. When he left I remained
alone, unable for some time to make
up my mind to go to bed, such was the spell
of the tropic moonlight and the distant half-heard
songs of the dancing “children of the
wilderness.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i056fp" style="max-width: 96.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_056fp.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A relic of the Portuguese occupation; an old well beside the trail</div>
</div>

<p>Early next morning we were on our way,
and that night were camped a few hundred
yards from the village of a grizzled old Sultani,
whose domains lay in the heart of the sable
country, for it was in search of these handsome
antelopes that I had come. In southern Africa
the adult males of the species are almost black,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
with white bellies, but here they were not so
dark in color, resembling more nearly the
southern female sable, which is a dark reddish
brown. Both sexes carry long horns that
sweep back in a graceful curve over the shoulders,
those of the male much heavier and
longer, sometimes, in the south, attaining five
feet in length. The sable antelope is a savage
animal, and when provoked, will attack man
or beast. The rapier-like horns prove an effective
weapon as many a dog has learned to its
cost.</p>

<p>My tent was pitched beneath one of the large
shade-trees in which the country abounds.
This one was the village council-tree, and when
I arrived the old men were seated beneath it
on little wooden stools. These were each
hacked out of a single log and were only five
or six inches high. The owner carried his
stool with him wherever he went, slinging it
over his shoulder on a bit of rawhide or a
chain.</p>

<p>There was trouble in the village, for after
the first formal greetings were over the old
chief told me that one of his sons had just
died. There was about to be held a dance in
his memory, and he led me over to watch it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
We arrived just as the ceremony was starting.
Only small boys were taking part in it, and it
was anything but a mournful affair, for each
boy had strung round his ankles baskets filled
with pebbles that rattled in time with the
rhythm of the dance. In piping soprano they
sang a lively air which, unlike any native
music I had hitherto heard, sounded distinctly
European, and would scarcely have been
out of place in a comic opera.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i058fp" style="max-width: 97.3125em;">

  <div class="caption">The Death Dance of the Wa Nyika children in memory of the chieftain’s little son
</div>
</div>

<p>When the dance was finished the Sultani
came back with me to my tent, and sitting
down on his stool beside me, we gossiped until
I was ready to go to bed. I had given him a
gorgeous green umbrella and a most meritorious
knife, promising him further presents should
success attend me in the chase. He, in addition
to the customary cocoanuts, had presented
me with some chickens and a large
supply of a carrot-shaped root called mihogo;
by no means a bad substitute for potatoes,
and eaten either raw or cooked; having in
the former state a slight chestnut flavor.</p>

<p>The first day’s hunting was a blank, for although
we climbed hill after hill and searched
the country with my spy-glasses, we saw nothing
but some kongoni (hartebeeste), and I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
no intention of risking disturbing the country
by shooting at them, much as the men would
have liked the meat. It was the rainy season,
and we were continually getting drenched
by showers, but between times the sun would
appear and in an incredibly short time we
would be dry again. The Sultani had given
me two guides, sturdy, cheerful fellows with
no idea of hunting, but knowing the country
well, which was all we wanted. We loaded
them down with cocoanuts, for in the middle
of the day when one was feeling tired and hot
it was most refreshing to cut a hole in a cocoanut
and drink the milk, eating the meat afterward.</p>

<p>The following day we made a very early
start, leaving camp amid a veritable tropical
downpour. For half an hour we threaded
our way through the semi-cultivated native
shambas; the rain soon stopped, the sun rose,
and we followed an overgrown trail through a
jungle of glistening leaves. Climbing a large
hill, we sat down among some rocks to reconnoitre.
Just as I was lighting my pipe I
saw Juma Yohari, one of my gun-bearers,
motioning excitedly. I crept over to him
and he pointed out, three-quarters of a mile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
away, a small band of sable crossing a little
open space between two thickets. The country
was difficult to hunt, for it was so furrowed
with valleys, down the most of which there ran
streams, that there was very little level land,
and that little was in the main bush country&mdash;the
Bara, as the natives called it. There were,
however, occasional open stretches, but during
the rainy season, as at present, the grass
was so high everywhere that it was difficult
to find game. We held a hurried consultation,
Juma, Kasitura&mdash;my other gun-bearer&mdash;and
myself; after a short disagreement we decided
upon the course, and set out as fast as we
safely could toward the point agreed on. It
was exhausting work: through ravines, up
hills, all amid a tangle of vines and thorns;
and once among the valleys it was hard to
know just where we were. When we reached
what we felt was the spot we had aimed at, we
could find no trace of our quarry, though we
searched stealthily in all directions. I led
the way toward a cluster of tall palms that
were surrounded by dense undergrowth. A
slight wind rose, and as I entered the thicket
with every nerve tense, I heard a loud and most
disconcerting crackle that caused me to jump<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
back on to Yohari, who was close behind me.
He grinned and pointed to some great dead
palm-leaves pendant along the trunk of one
of the trees that the wind had set in motion.
The next instant I caught sight of a pair of
horns moving through the brush. On making
out the general outline of the body, I fired.
Another antelope that I had not seen made off,
and taking it for a female I again fired, bringing
it down with a most lucky shot. I had
hoped to collect male, female, and young for
the museum, so I was overjoyed, believing that
I had on the second day’s hunting managed to
get the two adults. Yohari and Kasitura
thought the same, but when we reached our
quarry we found them to be both males; the
latter a young one, and the former, although
full grown in body, by no means the tawny
black color of an old bull. We set to work on
the skins, and soon had them off. Juma took
one of the Shenzies<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and went back to camp
with the skins, while Kasitura and I went on
with the other. We returned to camp by
moonlight that night without having seen
any more game. The porters had gone out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and brought in the meat and there was a grand
feast in progress.</p>

<p>After some antelope-steak and a couple of
cups of tea I tumbled into bed and was soon
sound asleep. The next thing I knew I was
wide awake, feeling as if there were fourscore
pincers at work on me. Bounding out of
bed, I ran for the camp-fire, which was still
flickering. I was covered with ants. They
had apparently attacked the boys sleeping
near me at about the same time, for the camp
was in an uproar and there was a hurrying of
black figures, and a torrent of angry Swahili
imprecations. There was nothing for it but
to beat an ignominious retreat, and we fled
in confusion. Once out of reach of reinforcements
we soon ridded ourselves of such of our
adversaries as were still on us. Fortunately
for us the assault had taken place not long before
dawn, and we returned to camp safely by
daylight.</p>

<p>That day we moved camp to the top of a
neighboring hill, about a mile from the village.
I spent the morning working over the
skins which I had only roughly salted the night
before; but in the afternoon we sallied forth
again to the hunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>We went through several unsuccessful days
before I again came up with sable. Several
times we had met with fresh tracks, and in
each case Kasitura, who was a strapping Basoga
from a tribe far inland and an excellent tracker,
took up the trail and did admirable work.
The country was invariably so dense and the
game so wary that in spite of Kasitura’s remarkable
tracking, only on two occasions did
we sight the quarry, and each time it was only
a fleeting glimpse as they crashed off. I could
have had a shot, but I was anxious not to kill
anything more save a full-grown female or an
old master bull; and it was impossible to determine
either sex or age.</p>

<p>On what was to be our last day’s hunting
we made a particularly early start and pushed
on and on through the wild bushland, stopping
occasionally to spy round from some vantage-point.
We would swelter up a hill, down into
the next valley among the lovely tall trees
that lined the brook, cross the cool, rock-strewn
stream, and on again. The sable fed
in the open only in the very early morning
till about nine o’clock, then they would retreat
into the thickets and doze until four or five
in the afternoon, when they would again come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
out to feed. During the intervening time our
only chance was to run across them by luck,
or find fresh tracks to follow. On that particular
day we climbed a high hill about noon to
take a look round and have a couple of hours’
siesta. I found a shady tree and sat down with
my back against the trunk. Ten miles or so
away sparkled and shimmered the Indian
Ocean. On all sides stretched the wonderful
bushland, here and there in the distance
broken by little patches of half-cultivated
land. There had been a rain-storm in the
morning, but now the sun was shining
undimmed. Taking from my hunting-coat
pocket Borrow’s <cite>Wild Wales</cite>, I was soon climbing
far-distant Snowdon with Lavengro, and
was only brought back to realities by Juma,
who came up to discuss the afternoon’s campaign.
We had scarcely begun when one of
the Shenzies, whom I had sent to watch from a
neighboring hill, came up in great excitement
to say that he had found a large sable bull.
We hurried along after him, and presently he
pointed to a thicket ahead of us. Leaving
the rest behind, Juma and I proceeded cautiously
toward the thicket. We found two
sable cows, which Juma felt sure were all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
that there were in the thicket, whereas I could
not help putting some faith in the Shenzi
who had been very insistent about the “big
bull.” I was convinced at length that Juma
was right, so I took aim at the better of the
cows. My shooting was poor, for I only
crippled her, and when I moved up close for a
final shot she attempted to charge, snorting
savagely, but too badly hit to cause any
trouble.</p>

<p>We had spent some time searching for the
bull, so that by the time we had the skin off,
the brief African twilight was upon us. We
had been hunting very hard for the last week,
and were all of us somewhat fagged, but as we
started toward camp I soon forgot my weariness
in the magic of the night. Before the
moon rose we trooped silently along, no one
speaking, but all listening to the strange
noises of the wilderness. We were following a
rambling native trail, which wound along a
deep valley beside a stream for some time
before it struck out across the hills for camp.
There was but little game in the country, still
occasionally we would hear a buck that had
winded us crashing off, or some animal splashing
across the stream. In the more open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
country the noise of the cicadas, loud and
incessant, took me back to the sound of the
katydids in summer nights on Long Island.
The moon rose large and round, outlining the
tall ivory-nut palms. It was as if we were
marching in fairyland, and with real regret I
at length caught the gleam of the camp-fire
through the trees.</p>

  <div class="caption">Across the bay from Mombasa; the porters ready to shoulder loads and march</div>
</div>

<p>It was after ten o’clock, when we had had
something to eat, but Juma, Kasitura, and I
gathered to work on the sable, and toiled until
we began to nod off to sleep as we skinned.</p>

<p>Next morning I paid my last visit to the old
Sultani, rewarding him as I had promised and
solemnly agreeing to come back and live with
him in his country. The porters were joyful,
as is always the case when they are headed
for Mombasa. Each thought of the joyous
time he would have spending his earnings,
and they sang in unison as they swung along
the trail&mdash;careless, happy children. I, too,
was in the best of spirits, for my quest had been
successful, and I was not returning empty-handed.</p>

THE SHEEP OF THE DESERT</h2>
</div>


<p>I wished to hunt the mountain-sheep of the
Mexican desert, hoping to be able to get a
series needed by the National Museum.</p>

<p>At Yuma, on the Colorado River, in the
extreme southwestern corner of Arizona, I
gathered my outfit. Doctor Carl Lumholtz,
the explorer, had recently been travelling and
hunting in that part of Mexico. In addition
to much valuable help as to outfitting, he told
me how to get hold of a Mexican who had
been with him and whom he had found trustworthy.
The postmaster, Mr. Chandler, and
Mr. Verdugo, a prominent business man, had
both been more than kind in helping in every
possible way. Mr. Charles Utting, clerk of
the District Court, sometime Rough Rider,
and inveterate prospector, was to start off with
me for a short holiday from judicial duties.
To him the desert was an open book, and from
long experience he understood all the methods
and needs of desert travel. Mr. Win Proebstel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
ranchman and prospector, was also to
start with us. He had shot mountain-sheep
all the way from Alaska to Mexico, and was
a mine of first-hand information as to their
habits and seasons. I had engaged two
Mexicans, Cipriano Dominguez and Eustacio
Casares.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 10th of August we
reached Wellton, a little station on the Southern
Pacific, some forty miles east of Yuma.
Win and his brother, Ike Proebstel, were ready
with a wagon, which the latter was to drive
to a water-hole some sixteen miles south, near
some mining claims of Win’s. August is the
hottest month in the year in that country, a
time when on the desert plains of Sonora the
thermometer marks 140 degrees; so we decided
to take advantage of a glorious full moon and
make our first march by night. We loaded as
much as we could of our outfit into the wagon,
so as to save our riding and pack animals. We
started at nine in the evening. The moon rode
high. At first the desert stretched in unbroken
monotony on all sides, to the dim and far-off
mountains. In a couple of hours we came to
the country of the saguaro, the giant cactus.
All around us, their shafts forty or fifty feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
high, with occasional branches set at grotesque
angles to the trunk, they rose from the level
floor of the desert, ghostly in the moonlight.
The air seemed cool in comparison with the
heat of the day, though the ground was still
warm to the touch.</p>

<p>Shortly before one in the morning we reached
Win’s water-hole&mdash;tank, in the parlance of
the country&mdash;and were soon stretched out on
our blankets, fast asleep.</p>

<p>Next day we loaded our outfit on our two
pack-mules and struck out across the desert
for the Tinajas Altas (High Tanks), which
lay on the slopes of a distant range of mountains,
about four miles from the Mexican
border. For generations these tanks have
been a well-known stepping-stone in crossing
the desert. There are a series of them, worn
out in the solid rock and extending up a cleft
in the mountainside, which, in time of rain,
becomes the course of a torrent. The usual
camping-place is a small plateau, a couple of
hundred yards from the lowest tank. This
plateau lies in a gulch and is sheltered on either
hand by its steep and barren sides. A few
hundred feet from the entrance, on the desert
and scattered about among the cactus, lie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
some hundred and fifty graves&mdash;the graves of
men who have died of thirst; for this is a grim
land, and death dogs the footsteps of those
who cross it. Most of the dead men were
Mexicans who had struggled across the deserts
only to find the tanks dry. Each lay where he
fell, until, sooner or later, some other traveller
found him and scooped out for him a shallow
grave, and on it laid a pile of rocks in the
shape of a rude cross. Forty-six unfortunates
perished here at one time of thirst. They
were making their way across the deserts to
the United States, and were in the last stages
of exhaustion for lack of water when they
reached these tanks. But a Mexican outlaw
named Blanco reached the tanks ahead of
them and bailed out the water, after carefully
laying in a store for himself not far away. By
this cache he waited until he felt sure that his
victims were dead; he then returned to the
tanks, gathered the possessions of the dead,
and safely made his escape.</p>

<p>A couple of months previously a band of
insurrectos had been camped by these tanks,
and two newly made graves marked their
contribution. The men had been killed in
a brawl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>Utting told us of an adventure that took
place here, a few years ago, which very nearly
had a tragic termination. It was in the
winter season and there was an American
camped at the tanks, when two Mexicans
came there on their way to the Tule tanks,
twenty-five miles away, near which they intended
to do some prospecting. Forty-eight
hours after they had left, one of them turned
up riding their pack-mule and in a bad way
for water. He said that they had found the
Tule tanks dry, but had resolved to have
one day’s prospecting anyway; they had
separated, but agreed at what time they
were to meet. Although he waited for a long
while after the agreed time, his companion
never appeared, and he was forced to start
back alone.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours after the return of this
Mexican, the American was awakened in the
night by hearing strange sounds in the bed
of the arroyo. When he went down to investigate
them he found the lost Mexican; he
was in a fearful condition, totally out of his
head, and was vainly struggling to crawl up
the bank of the arroyo, in order to make the
last hundred yards across the plateau to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
water-hole. He would never have reached it
alone. By careful treatment the American
brought him round and then listened to his
story. He had lost himself when he went off
prospecting, and when he finally got his bearings
he was already in a very bad way for
water. Those dwelling in cool, well-watered
regions can hardly make themselves realize
what thirst means in that burning desert.
He knew that although there was no water in
the Tule wells, there was some damp mud in
the bottom, and he said that all he wished to
do was to reach the wells and cool himself off
in the mud before he died. A short distance
from the tanks the trail he was following divided,
one branch leading to the Tule wells
and the other back to the Tinajas Altas, twenty-five
miles away. The Mexican was so crazed
that he took the wrong branch, and before he
realized his mistake he had gone some way past
Tule; he then decided that it was the hand of
providence that had led him past, and that he
must try to make Tinajas Altas; a feat which
he would have just missed accomplishing but
for the American encamped there.</p>

<p>The morning after we reached the tanks,
the Tinah’alta, as they are called colloquially,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
Win and I were up and off for the hunting-grounds
by half past three; by sun-up we
were across the border, and hunted along the
foot of the mountains, climbing across the out-jutting
ridges. At about nine we reached the
top of a ridge and began looking around.
Win called to me that he saw some sheep.
We didn’t manage things very skilfully, and
the sheep took fright, but as they stopped I
shot at a fine ram, Win’s rifle echoing my shot.
We neither of us scored a hit, and missed
several running shots. This missing was mere
bad luck on Win’s part, for he was a crack shot,
and later on that day, when we were not together,
he shot a ram, only part of which was
visible, at a distance of three hundred and
fifty yards. As the sun grew hotter we hunted
farther up on the mountains, but we saw no
more sheep, and returned to camp with Utting,
who met us at a ravine near the border.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i078fp" style="max-width: 97.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_078fp.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A desert camp in old Mexico</div>
</div>

<p>After we got back to camp, Win and I
filled some canteens, threw our blankets on
one of the pack-mules, took Dominguez, and
rode back over the border to camp in the dry
bed of an arroyo near where we had been hunting
in the morning. We sent back the animals,
arranging with Dominguez to return with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
them the following day. Next morning at a
little after three we rolled out of our blankets,
built a little fire of mesquite wood, and after
a steaming cup of coffee and some cold frying-pan
bread we shouldered our rifles and set
out. At the end of several hours’ steady walking
I got a chance at a fair ram and missed.
I sat down and took out my field-glasses to
try to see where he went; and I soon picked
up three sheep standing on a great boulder,
near the foot of a mountain of the same range
that we were on. They were watching us
and were all ewes, but I wanted one for the
museum. So I waited till they lost interest
in us, got down from the rock, and disappeared
from our sight. I then left Win and started
toward the boulder; after some rather careful
stalking I got one of them at about two hundred
yards by some fairly creditable shooting.
The side of the mountain range along which
we were hunting was cut by numerous deep
gullies from two to three hundred yards across.
After I had dressed the ewe I thought I would
go a little way farther, on the chance of coming
upon the ram I had missed; for he had
disappeared in that direction. When I had
crossed three or four ridges I sat down to look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
around. It was about half past nine, the heat
was burning, and I knew the sheep would soon
be going up the mountains to seek the shelter
of the caves in which they spend the noonday
hours. Suddenly I realized that there were
some sheep on the side of the next ridge standing
quietly watching me. There were four
bunches, scattered among the rocks; three
were of ewes and young, and there was one
bunch of rams; in all there were sixteen sheep.
I picked out the best ram, and, estimating
the distance at two hundred and fifty yards,
I fired, hitting, but too low. I failed to score
in the running shooting, but when he was out
of sight I hurried over and picked up the trail;
he was bleeding freely, and it was not difficult
to follow him. He went half a mile or so and
then lay down in a rock cave; but he was up
and off before I could labor into sight, and
made a most surprising descent down the
side of a steep ravine. When I caught sight
of him again he was half-way up the opposite
wall of the ravine though only about a hundred
yards distant; he was standing behind a
large rock with only his quarters visible, but
one more shot brought matters to a finish.
The heat was very great, so I started right to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
work to get the skin off. A great swarm of
bees gathered to the feast. They were villainous-looking,
and at first they gave me many
qualms, but we got used to each other and I
soon paid no attention to them, merely brushing
them off any part that I wanted to skin.
I was only once stung, and that was when a
bee got inside my clothing and I inadvertently
squeezed it. Before I had finished the skinning
I heard a shot from Win; I replied, and
a little while afterward he came along. I shall
not soon forget packing the skin, with the
head and the leg-bones still in it, down that
mountainside. In addition to being very
heavy, it made an unwieldy bundle, as I had
no rope with which to tie it up. I held the
head balanced on one shoulder, with a horn
hooked round my neck; the legs I bunched
together as best I could, but they were continually
coming loose and causing endless trouble.
After I reached the bottom, I left Win
with the sheep and struck off for our night’s
camping-place. It was after eleven and the
very hottest part of the day. I had to be
careful not to touch any of the metal part of
my gun; indeed, the wooden stock was unpleasantly
hot, and I was exceedingly glad that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
there was to be water waiting for me at
camp.</p>

<p>I got Dominguez and the horses and brought
in the sheep, which took several hours. That
afternoon we were back at Tinah’alta, with a
long evening’s work ahead of me skinning out
the heads and feet by starlight. Utting, who
was always ready to do anything at any time,
and did everything well, turned to with a will
and took the ewe off my hands.</p>

<p>The next day I was hard at work on the
skins. One of the tanks, about four hundred
yards from camp, was a great favorite with the
sheep, and more than once during our stay the
men in camp saw sheep come down to drink
at it. This had generally happened when I
was off hunting; but on the morning when I
was busy with the skins two rams came down
to drink. It was an hour before noon; for
at this place the sheep finished feeding before
they drank. The wind was blowing directly up
the gulch to them, but although they stopped
several times to stare at the camp, they eventually
came to the water-hole and drank.
Of course we didn’t disturb these sheep, for
not only were they in the United States, but
they were drinking at a water-hole in a desert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
country; and a man who has travelled the
deserts, and is any sort of a sportsman, would
not shoot game at a water-hole unless he were
in straits for food.</p>

<p>I had been hunting on the extreme end of
the Gila Range and near a range called El
Viejo Hombre (The Old Man). After I shot
my ram, in the confusion that followed, two
of the young rams broke back, came down the
mountain, passing quite close to Win, and
crossed the plain to the Viejo Hombre Range,
some mile and a half away. The bands of
sheep out of which I shot my specimens had
been feeding chiefly on the twigs of a small
symmetrical bush, called by the Mexicans El
Yervo del Baso, the same, I believe, that Professor
Hornaday in his <cite>Camp-Fires on Desert
and Lava</cite> calls the white Brittle bush. They
had also been eating such galleta-grass as
they could find; it was on this grass that we
depended for food for our horses and mules.
Apparently the sheep of these bands had not
been going to the water-hole; there were numerous
places where they had been breaking
down cactus and eating the pulp. In this
country Win said that the rams and the ewes
began to run together in October, and that in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
February the young were born. When the
rams left the ewes, they took with them the
yearling rams, and they didn’t join the ewes
again until the next October.</p>

<p>On the following day I left Utting and Proebstel
and took the trail to the Tule tank. The
two Mexicans were with me and we had two
horses and three mules. We were travelling
very light, for we were bound for a country
where water-holes were not only few and far
between but most uncertain. My personal
baggage consisted of my washing kit, an extra
pair of shoes, a change of socks, and a couple
of books. Besides our bedding we had some
coffee, tea, sugar, rice, flour (with a little bacon
to take the place of lard in making bread), and
a good supply of frijoles, or Mexican beans.
It was on these last that we really lived. As
soon as we got to a camp we always put some
frijoles in a kettle and started a little fire to
boil them. If we were to be there for a couple
of days we put in enough beans to last us the
whole time, and then all that was necessary in
getting a meal ready was to warm up the beans.</p>

<p>It was between four and five in the afternoon
when we left Tinah’alta, and though
the moon did not rise until late, the stars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
were bright and the trail was clear. The
desert we were riding through was covered
with mesquite and creosote and innumerable
choya cactus; there were also two kinds of
prickly-pear cactus, and ocatillas were plentiful.
The last are curious plants; they are
formed somewhat on the principle of an umbrella,
with a very short central stem from
which sometimes as many as twenty spokes
radiate umbrella-wise. These spokes are generally
about six feet long and are covered with
thorns which are partially concealed by tiny
leaves. The flower of the ocatilla is scarlet,
and although most of them had stopped flowering
by August, there were a few still in bloom.
After about six hours’ silent riding we reached
Tule. The word means a marsh, but, needless
to say, all that we found was a rock-basin
with a fair supply of water and a very generous
supply of tadpoles and water-lice.</p>

<p>Next morning when we came to get breakfast
ready we found we had lost, through a
hole in a pack-sack, all of our eating utensils
except a knife and two spoons; but we were
thankful at having got off so easily. By three
in the afternoon we were ready for what was
to be our hardest march. We wished to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
into the Pinacate country; and our next water
was to be the Papago tank, which Casares
said was about forty-five miles south of us.
He said that in this tank we were always sure
to find water.</p>

<p>For the first fifteen miles our route lay over
the Camino del Diablo, a trail running through
the Tule desert&mdash;and it has proved indeed a
“road of the devil” for many an unfortunate.
Then we left the trail, the sun sank, twilight
passed, and in spite of the brilliancy of the
stars, the going became difficult. In many
places where the ground was free from boulders
the kangaroo-rats had made a network of
tunnels, and into these our animals fell, often
sinking shoulder-deep. Casares was leading,
riding a hardy little white mule. While he
rode he rolled cigarette after cigarette, and as
he bent forward in his saddle to light them,
for a moment his face would be brought into
relief by the burning match and a trail of sparks
would light up the succeeding darkness. Once
his mule shied violently, and we heard the angry
rattling of a side-winder, a sound which once
heard is never forgotten.</p>

<p>At about eight o’clock, what with rocks and
kangaroo-rat burrows, the going became so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
bad that we decided to offsaddle and wait
till the moon should rise. We stretched out
with our heads on our saddles and dozed until
about midnight, when it was time to start on
again. Soon the desert changed and we were
free of the hills among which we had been
travelling, and were riding over endless rolling
dunes of white sand. As dawn broke, the twin
peaks of Pinacate appeared ahead of us, and
the sand gave place to a waste of red and black
lava, broken by steep arroyos. We had been
hearing coyotes during the night, and now a
couple jumped up from some rocks, a hundred
yards away, and made off amongst the lava.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock the sun was fiercely hot,
but we were in among the foot-hills of Pinacate.
I asked Casares where the tanks were, and he
seemed rather vague, but said they were beyond
the next hills. They were not; but
several times more he felt sure they were
“just around the next hill.” I realized that
we were lost and resolved to give him one more
try, and then if I found that he was totally at
sea as to the whereabouts of the tank, I intended
to find some shelter for the heat of the
day, and, when it got cooler, to throw the
packs off our animals and strike back to Tule.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
It is difficult to realize how quickly that fierce
sun dries up man and beast. I doubt if in
that country a really good walker could have
covered ten miles in the noonday heat without
water and without stopping. We could have
made Tule all right, but the return trip would
have been a very unpleasant one, and we
would probably have lost some of our animals.</p>

<p>However, just before we reached Casares’s
last location of the Papago tanks, we came
upon an unknown water-hole, in the bed of an
arroyo. The rains there are very local, and
although the rest of the country was as dry as
tinder, some fairly recent downpour had filled
up this little rocky basin. There were two
trees near it, a mesquite and a palo verde, and
though neither would fit exactly into the category
of shade-trees, we were most grateful
to them for being there at all. The palo verde
is very deceptive. When seen from a distance,
its greenness gives it a false air of being a
lovely, restful screen from the sun, but when
one tries to avail oneself of its shade, the
fallacy is soon evident. It is only when there
is some parasitical mistletoe growing on it
that the palo verde offers any real shade.
The horses were very thirsty, and it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
revelation to see how they lowered the water
in the pool.</p>

<p>Dominguez was only about thirty years
old, but he seemed jaded and tired, whereas
Casares, who was white-haired, and must
have been at least sixty, was as fresh as ever.
Two days later, when I was off hunting on
the mountains, Casares succeeded in finding
the Papago tanks; they were about fifteen
miles to our northwest, and were as dry as a
bone! I later learned that a Mexican had
come through this country some three weeks
before we were in there. He had a number of
pack-animals. When he found the Papago
dry, he struck on for the next water, and succeeded
in making it only after abandoning his
packs and losing most of his horses.</p>

<p>We sat under our two trees during the heat
of the day; but shortly after four I took my
rifle and my canteen and went off to look for
sheep, leaving the two Mexicans in camp.
Although I saw no rams, I found plenty of
sign and got a good idea of the lay of the land.</p>

  <div class="caption">Casares on his white mule</div>
</div>

<p>The next four or five days I spent hunting
from this camp. I was very anxious to get
some antelope, and I spent three or four days
in a fruitless search for them. It was, I believe,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
unusually dry, even for that country,
and the antelope had migrated to better feeding-grounds.
Aside from a herd of nine,
which I saw from a long way off but failed
to come up with, not only did I not see any
antelope, but I did not even find any fresh
tracks. There were many very old tracks,
and I have no doubt that, at certain times of
the year, there are great numbers of antelope
in the country over which I was hunting.</p>

<p>The long rides, however, were full of interest.
I took the Mexicans on alternate days, and we
always left camp before daylight. As the
hours wore on, the sun would grow hotter and
hotter. In the middle of the day there was
generally a breeze blowing across the lava-beds,
and that breeze was like the blast from
a furnace. There are few whom the desert,
at sunset and sunrise, fails to fascinate; but
only those who have the love of the wastes
born in them feel the magic of their appeal
under the scorching noonday sun. Reptile
life was abundant; lizards scuttled away in
every direction; there were some rather large
ones that held their tails up at an oblique
angle above the ground as they ran, which
gave them a ludicrous appearance. A species<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
of toad whose back was speckled with red was
rather common. Jack-rabbits and cottontails
were fairly numerous, and among the birds
Gambel’s quail and the whitewings, or sonora
pigeons, were most in evidence. I came upon
one of these later on her nest in a palo-verde-tree;
the eggs were about the size of a robin’s
and were white, and the nest was made chiefly
of galleta-grass. The whitewings are very
fond of the fruit of the saguaro; this fruit is
of a reddish-orange color when ripe, and the
birds peck a hole in it and eat the scarlet pulp
within. It is delicious, and the Indians collect
it and dry it; the season was over when I
was in the country, but there was some late
fruit on a few of the trees. When I was back
in camp at sunset it was pleasant to hear the
pigeons trilling as they flew down to the pool
to drink.</p>

<p>One day we returned to the camp at about
two. I was rather hot and tired, so I made a
cup of tea and sat under the trees and smoked
my pipe until almost four. Then I picked up
my rifle and went out by myself to look for
sheep. I climbed to the top of a great crater
hill and sat down to look around with my field-glasses.
Hearing a stone move behind, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
turned very slowly around. About a hundred
and fifty yards off, on the rim of the crater,
stood six sheep, two of them fine rams. Very
slowly I put down the field-glasses and raised
my rifle, and I killed the finer of the rams.
It was getting dark, so, without bestowing more
than a passing look upon him, I struck off for
camp at a round pace. Now the Mexicans,
although good enough in the saddle, were no
walkers, and so Dominguez saddled a horse,
put a pack-saddle on a mule, and followed me
back to where the sheep lay. We left the
animals at the foot of the hill, and although
it was not a particularly hard climb up to the
sheep, the Mexican was blown and weary by
the time we reached it. The ram was a good
one. His horns measured sixteen and three-fourths
inches around the base and were
thirty-five inches long, so they were larger
in circumference though shorter than my
first specimen. He was very thin, however,
and his hair was falling out, so that one could
pull it out in handfuls. All the sheep that I
saw in this country seemed thin and in poor
shape, while those near Tinah’alta were in
very fair condition. The extreme dryness and
scarcity of grass doubtless in part accounted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
for this, although the country in which I got
my first two sheep was in no sense green.
Making our way back to camp through the
lava-fields and across the numerous gullies
was a difficult task. The horses got along
much better than I should have supposed; indeed,
they didn’t seem to find as much difficulty
as I did. Dominguez muttered that if
the road past Tule was the Camino del Diablo,
this certainly was the Camino del Infierno!
When we reached camp my clothes were as
wet as if I had been in swimming. I set right
to work on the headskin, but it was eleven
o’clock before I had finished it; that meant
but four hours’ sleep for me, and I felt somewhat
melancholy about it. Indeed, on this
trip, the thing that I chiefly felt was the need
of sleep, for it was always necessary to make
a very early start, and it was generally after
sunset before I got back to camp.</p>

<p>The Mexicans spoke about as much English
as I spoke Spanish, which was very little, and
as they showed no signs of learning, I set to
work to learn some Spanish. At first our conversation
was very limited, but I soon got so
that I could understand them pretty well. We
occasionally tried to tell each other stories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
but became so confused that we would have
to call it off. Dominguez had one English expression
which he would pronounce with great
pride and emphasis on all appropriate or inappropriate
occasions; it was “You betcher!”
Once he and I had some discussion as to what
day it was and I appealed to Casares. “Ah,
quien sabe, quien sabe?” (who knows, who
knows?) was his reply; he said that he never
knew what day it was and got on very comfortably
without knowing&mdash;a point of view
which gave one quite a restful feeling. They
christened our water-hole Tinaja del Bévora,
which means the tank of the rattlesnake.
They so named it because of the advent in
camp one night of a rattler. It escaped and
got in a small lava-cave, from out of which the
men tried long and unsuccessfully to smoke it.</p>

<p>At the place where we were camped our arroyo
had tunnelled its way along the side of a
hill; so that, from its bed, one bank was about
ten feet high and the other nearer fifty. In
the rocky wall of this latter side there were
many caves. One, in particular, would have
furnished good sleeping quarters for wet
weather. It was about twenty-five feet long
and fifteen feet deep, and it varied in height<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
from four to six feet. The signs showed that
for generations it had been a favorite abode
of sheep; coyotes had also lived in it, and in
the back there was a big pack-rat’s nest.
Pieces of the bisnaga cactus, with long, cruel
spikes, formed a prominent part of the nest.</p>

<p>After I had hunted for antelope in every
direction from camp, and within as large a
radius as I could manage, I was forced to admit
the hopelessness of the task. The water-supply
was getting low, but I determined to
put in another good long day with the sheep
before turning back. Accordingly, early one
morning, I left the two Mexicans in camp to
rest and set off for the mountains on foot. I
headed for the main peak of Pinacate. It was
not long before I got in among the foot-hills.
I kept down along the ravines, for it was
very early, and as a rule the sheep didn’t begin
to go up the hills from their night’s feeding
until nine or ten o’clock; at this place,
also, they almost always spent the noon hours
in caves. There were many little chipmunks
running along with their tails arched forward
over their backs, which gave them rather a
comical look. At length I saw a sheep; he
was well up the side of a large hill, an old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
crater, as were many of these mountains. I
made off after him and found there were steep
ravines to be reckoned with before I even
reached the base of the hill. The sides of
the crater were covered with choyas, and the
footing on the loose lava was so uncertain that
I said to myself, “I wonder how long it will
be before you fall into one of these choyas,”
and only a few minutes later I was gingerly
picking choya burrs off my arms, which had
come off worst in the fall. The points of the
spikes are barbed and are by no means easy
to pull out. I stopped many times to wait for
my courage to rise sufficiently to start to work
again, and by the time I had got myself free
I was so angry that I felt like devoting the
rest of my day to waging a war of retaliation
upon the cactus. The pain from the places
from which I had pulled out the spikes lasted
for about half an hour after I was free of them,
and later, at Yuma, I had to have some of the
spines that I had broken off in my flesh cut
out.</p>

<p>An hour or so later I came across a very
fine bisnaga, or “niggerhead,” cactus. I was
feeling very thirsty, and, wishing to save my
canteen as long as possible, I decided to cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the bisnaga open and eat some of its pulp,
for this cactus always contains a good supply
of sweetish water. As I was busy trying to
remove the long spikes, I heard a rock fall,
and looking round saw a sheep walking along
the opposite side of the gully, and not more than
four hundred yards away. He was travelling
slowly and had not seen me, so I hastily made
for a little ridge toward which he was heading.
I reached some rocks near the top of the ridge
in safety and crouched behind them. I soon
saw that he was only a two-year-old, and
when he was two hundred yards off I stood up
to have a good look at him. When he saw
me, instead of immediately making off, he
stood and gazed at me. I slowly sat down and
his curiosity quite overcame him. He proceeded
to stalk me in a most scientific manner,
taking due advantage of choyas and rocks;
and cautiously poking his head out from behind
them to stare at me. He finally got to
within fifty feet of me, but suddenly, and for
no apparent reason, he took fright and made
off. He did not go far, and, from a distance
of perhaps five hundred yards, watched me as
I resumed operations on the cactus.</p>

<p>Not long after this, as I was standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
top of a hill, I made out two sheep, half hidden
in a draw. There was a great difference in
the size of their horns, and, in the hasty glance
I got of them, one seemed to me to be big
enough to warrant shooting. I did not discover
my mistake until I had brought down my
game. He was but a two-year-old, and, although
I should have been glad of a good specimen
for the museum, his hide was in such poor
condition that it was quite useless. However,
I took his head and some meat and headed
back for camp. My camera, water-bottle,
and field-glasses were already slung over my
shoulder, and the three hours’ tramp back
to camp, in the very hottest part of the day,
was tiring; and I didn’t feel safe in finishing
my canteen until I could see camp.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_096fp.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Making fast the sheep’s head</div>
</div>

<p>The next day we collected as much galleta-grass
as we could for the horses, and, having
watered them well, an operation which practically
finished our pool, we set out for Tule at
a little after three. As soon as the Mexicans
got a little saddle-stiff they would stand up
in one stirrup, crooking the other knee over
the saddle, and keeping the free heel busy at
the horses’ ribs. The result was twofold: the
first and most obvious being a sore back for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the horses, and the second being that the horses
became so accustomed to a continual tattoo to
encourage them to improve their pace, that,
with a rider unaccustomed to that method,
they lagged most annoyingly. The ride back
to Tule was as uneventful as it was lovely.</p>

<p>On the next day’s march, from Tule toward
Win’s tank, I saw the only Gila monster&mdash;the
sluggish, poisonous lizard of the southwestern
deserts&mdash;that I came across throughout
the trip. He was crossing the trail in
leisurely fashion and darted his tongue out
angrily as I stopped to admire him. Utting
told me of an interesting encounter he once
saw between a Gila monster and a rattlesnake.
He put the two in a large box; they were in
opposite corners, but presently the Gila monster
started slowly and sedately toward the
rattler’s side of the box. He paid absolutely
no attention to the snake, who coiled himself
up and rattled angrily. When the lizard got
near enough, the rattler struck out two or
three times, each time burying his fangs in
the Gila monster’s body; the latter showed not
the slightest concern, and, though Utting
waited expectantly for him to die, he apparently
suffered no ill effects whatever from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
encounter. He showed neither anger nor pain;
he simply did not worry himself about the rattler
at all.</p>

<p>We reached Wellton at about nine in the
evening of the second day from Pinacate.
We had eaten all our food, and our pack-animals
were practically without loads; so we
had made ninety miles in about fifty-five hours.
Dominguez had suffered from the heat on
the way back, and at Win’s tank, which was
inaccessible to the horses, I had been obliged
myself to pack all the water out to the animals.
At Wellton I parted company with the Mexicans,
with the regret one always feels at leaving
the comrades of a hunting trip that has
proved both interesting and successful.</p>

After Moose in New Brunswick</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
AFTER MOOSE IN NEW BRUNSWICK</h2>
</div>


<p>It was early in September when the four of
us&mdash;Clarke, Jamieson, Thompson, and myself&mdash;landed
at Bathurst, on Chaleur Bay, and
took the little railroad which runs twenty
miles up the Nepisiquit River to some iron-mines.
From that point we expected to pole
up the river about forty miles farther and
then begin our hunting.</p>

<p>For the four hunters&mdash;“sports” was what
the guides called us&mdash;there were six guides.
Three of them bore the name Venneau; there
were Bill Grey and his son Willie, and the
sixth was Wirre (pronounced Warry) Chamberlain.
Among themselves the guides spoke
French&mdash;or a corruption of French&mdash;which
was hard to understand and which has come
down from generation to generation without
ever getting into written form. A fine-looking
six they were,&mdash;straight,&mdash;with the Indian
showing in their faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>At the end of the third day of poling&mdash;a lazy
time for the “sports,” but three days of marvellously
skilful work for the guides&mdash;our
heavily laden canoes were brought up to the
main camp. From here we expected to start
our hunting expeditions, each taking a guide,
blankets, and food, and striking off for the
more isolated cabins in the woods. My purpose
was to collect specimens for the National
Museum at Washington. I wanted moose,
caribou, and beaver&mdash;a male and female of
each species. Whole skins and leg-bones were
to be brought out.</p>

<p>A hard rain woke us, and the prospects
were far from cheerful as we packed and prepared
to separate. Bill Grey was to be my
guide, and the “Popple Cabin,” three miles
away, was to be our shelter. Our tramp
through the wet woods&mdash;pine, hemlock, birch,
and poplar&mdash;ended at the little double lean-to
shelter. After we had started a fire and
spread our blankets to dry we set off in search
of game.</p>

<p>We climbed out of the valley in which we
were camped and up to the top of a hill from
which we could get a good view of some small
barren stretches that lay around us. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the blueberry season, and these barrens were
covered with bushes, all heavily laden. We
moved around from hill to hill in search of
game, but saw only three deer. We’d have
shot one of them for meat, but didn’t care to
run the chance of frightening away any moose
or caribou. The last hill we climbed overlooked
a small pond which lay beside a pine
forest on the edge of a barren strip. Bill intended
to spend a good part of each day watching
this pond, and it was to a small hill overlooking
it that we made our way early next
morning.</p>

<p>Before we had been watching many minutes,
a cow moose with a calf appeared at the edge
of the woods. She hesitated for several minutes,
listening intently and watching sharply,
and then stepped out across the barren on her
way to the pond. Before she had gone far,
the path she was following cut the trail we
had made on our way to the lookout hill. She
stopped immediately and began to sniff at
our tracks, the calf following her example;
a few seconds were enough to convince her,
but for some reason, perhaps to make doubly
sure, she turned and for some minutes followed
along our trail with her nose close to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Then she swung round and struck off into the
woods at a great slashing moose trot.</p>

<p>Not long after she had disappeared, we got
a fleeting glimpse of two caribou cows; they
lacked the impressive ungainliness of the moose,
and in the distance might easily have been
mistaken for deer.</p>

<p>It was a very cold morning, and throughout
the day it snowed and sleeted at intervals.
We spent the time wandering from hill to hill.</p>

<p>For the next week we hunted industriously
in every direction from the Popple Cabin. In
the morning and the evening we shifted from
hill to hill; the middle of the day we hunted
along the numerous brooks that furrowed the
country. With the exception of one or two
days, the weather was uniformly cold and
rainy; but after our first warm sunny day we
welcomed rain and cold, for then, at least, we
had no black flies to fight. On the two sunny
days they surrounded us in swarms and made
life almost unbearable; they got into our
blankets and kept us from sleeping during the
nights; they covered us with lumps and sores&mdash;Bill
said that he had never seen them as
bad.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i106fp" style="max-width: 96.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_106fp.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption">A noonday halt on the way down river, returning from the hunting country</div>
</div>

<p>It was lovely in the early morning to stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
on some high hill and watch the mist rising
lazily from the valley; it was even more lovely
to watch the approach of a rain-storm. The
sunlight on some distant hillside or valley
would suddenly be blotted out by a sheet of
rain; a few minutes later the next valley would
be darkened as the storm swept toward us,
and perhaps before it reached us we could see
the farther valleys over which it had passed
lightening again.</p>

<p>We managed to cover a great deal of ground
during that week, and were rewarded by seeing
a fair amount of game&mdash;four caribou, of
which one was a bull, a bull and three cow
moose, and six does and one buck deer. I
had but one shot, and that was at a buck deer.
We wanted meat very much, and Bill said that
he didn’t think one shot would disturb the
moose and caribou. He was a very large
buck, in prime condition; I never tasted better
venison. Had our luck been a little better,
I would have had a shot at a moose and a caribou;
we saw the latter from some distance,
and made a long and successful stalk until
Wirre, on his way from the main camp with
some fresh supplies, frightened our quarry
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>On these trips between camps, Wirre several
times saw moose and caribou within range.</p>

<p>After a week we all foregathered at the main
camp. Clarke had shot a fine bear and Jamieson
brought in a good moose head. They
started down-river with their trophies, and
Thompson and I set out for new hunting-grounds.
As Bill had gone with Jamieson, I
took his son Willie, a sturdy, pony-built fellow
of just my age. We crossed the river and
camped some two miles beyond it and about
a mile from the lake we intended to hunt.
We put up a lean-to, and in front of it built a
great fire of old pine logs, for the nights were
cold.</p>

<p>My blankets were warm, and it was only
after a great deal of wavering hesitation that
I could pluck up courage to roll out of them in
the penetrating cold of early morning. On
the second morning, as we made our way
through dew-soaked underbrush to the lake,
we came out upon a little glade, at the farther
end of which stood a caribou. He sprang
away as he saw us, but halted behind a bush
to reconnoitre&mdash;the victim of a fatal curiosity,
for it gave me my opportunity and I brought
him down. Although he was large in body, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
had a very poor head. I spent a busy morning
preparing the skin, but in the afternoon we
were again at the lake watching for moose.
We spent several fruitless days there.</p>

<p>One afternoon a yearling bull moose appeared:
he had apparently lost his mother, for
he wandered aimlessly around for several hours,
bewailing his fate. This watching would have
been pleasant enough as a rest-cure, but
since I was hunting and very anxious to get
my game, it became a rather irksome affair.
However, I could only follow Saint Augustine’s
advice, “when in Rome, fast on Saturdays,”
and I resigned myself to adopting Willie’s
plan of waiting for the game to come to us
instead of pursuing my own inclination and
setting out to find the game. Luckily, I had
some books with me, and passed the days
pleasantly enough reading Voltaire and Boileau.
There was a beaver-house at one end
of the lake, and between four and five the
beaver would come out and swim around. I
missed a shot at one. Red squirrels were very
plentiful and would chatter excitedly at us
from a distance of a few feet. There was one
particularly persistent little chap who did
everything in his power to attract attention.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
He would sit in the conventional squirrel attitude
upon a branch, and chirp loudly, bouncing
stiffly forward at each chirp, precisely as if he
were an automaton.</p>

<p>When we decided that it was useless to hunt
this lake any longer, we went back to the
river to put in a few days hunting up and down
it. I got back to the camp in the evening and
found Thompson there. He had had no luck
and intended to leave for the settlement in
the morning. Accordingly, the next day he
started downstream and we went up. We
hadn’t been gone long before we heard what
we took to be two shots, though, for all we
knew, they might have been a beaver striking
the water with his tail. That night, when we
got back to camp, we found that, on going
round a bend in the river about a mile below
camp, Thompson had come upon a bull and a
cow moose, and had bagged the bull.</p>

<p>The next morning it was raining as if it
were the first storm after a long drought, and
as we felt sure that no sensible moose would
wander around much amid such a frozen
downpour, we determined to put in a day
after beaver. In one of my long tramps with
Bill we had come across a large beaver-pond,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and at the time Bill had remarked how easy it
would be to break the dam and shoot the
beaver. I had carefully noted the location of
this pond, so managed successfully to pilot
Willie to it, and we set to work to let the water
out. This breaking the dam was not the
easy matter I had imagined. It was a big
pond, and the dam that was stretched across
its lower end was from eight to ten feet high.
To look at its solid structure and the size of
the logs that formed it, it seemed inconceivable
that an animal the size of a beaver could
have built it. The water was above our
heads, and there was a crust of ice around the
edges. We had to get in and work waist-deep
in the water to enlarge our break in the
dam, and the very remembrance of that cold
morning’s work, trying to pry out logs with
frozen fingers, makes me shiver. It was even
worse when we had to stop work and wait
and watch for the beavers to come out. They
finally did, and I shot two. They were fine
large specimens; the male was just two inches
less than four feet and the female only one inch
shorter. Shivering and frozen, we headed
back for camp. My hunting costume had
caused a good deal of comment among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
guides; it consisted of a sleeveless cotton undershirt,
a many-pocketed coat, a pair of short
khaki trousers reaching to just above my
knees, and then a pair of sneakers or of high
boots&mdash;I used the former when I wished to
walk quietly. My knees were always bare
and were quite as impervious to cold as my
hands, but the guides could never understand
why I didn’t freeze. I used to hear them
solemnly discussing it in their broken French.</p>

<p>I had at first hoped to get my moose by fair
stalking, without the help of calling, but I
had long since abandoned that hope; and
Willie, who was an excellent caller, had been
doing his best, but with no result. We saw
several cow moose, and once Willie called out
a young bull, but his horns could not have had
a spread of more than thirty-five inches, and
he would have been quite useless as a museum
specimen. Another time, when we were crawling
up to a lake not far from the river, we found
ourselves face to face with a two-year-old
bull. He was very close to us, but as he hadn’t
got our wind, he was merely curious to find out
what we were, for Willie kept grunting through
his birch-bark horn. Once he came up to
within twenty feet of us and stood gazing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Finally he got our wind and crashed off through
the lakeside alders.</p>

<p>As a rule, moose answer a call better at
night, and almost every night we could hear
them calling around our camp; generally they
were cows that we heard, and once Willie
had a duel with a cow as to which should
have a young bull that we could hear in an
alder thicket, smashing the bushes with his
horns. Willie finally triumphed, and the bull
headed toward us with a most disconcerting
rush; next morning we found his tracks at
the edge of the clearing not more than twenty
yards from where we had been standing;
at that point the camp smoke and smells
had proved more convincing than Willie’s
calling-horn.</p>

<p>Late one afternoon I had a good opportunity
to watch some beaver at work. We
had crawled cautiously up to a small lake in
the vain hope of finding a moose, when we
came upon some beaver close to the shore.
Their house was twenty or thirty yards away,
and they were bringing out a supply of wood,
chiefly poplar, for winter food. To and fro
they swam, pushing the wood in front of them.
Occasionally one would feel hungry, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
he would stop and start eating the bark from
the log he was pushing. It made me shiver
to watch them lying lazily in that icy water.</p>

<p>I had already stayed longer than I intended,
and the day was rapidly approaching when I
should have to start down-river. Even the
cheerful Willie was getting discouraged, and
instead of accounts of the miraculous bags
hunters made at the end of their trips, I began
to be told of people who were unfortunate
enough to go out without anything. I made
up my mind to put in the last few days hunting
from the Popple Cabin, so one rainy noon,
after a morning’s hunt along the river, we
shouldered our packs and tramped off to the
little cabin from which Bill and I had hunted.
Wirre was with us, and we left him to dry out
the cabin while we went off to try a late afternoon’s
hunt. As we were climbing the hill
from which Bill and I used to watch the little
pond, Willie caught sight of a moose on the
side of a hill a mile away. One look through
our field-glasses convinced us it was a good
bull. A deep wooded valley intervened, and
down into it we started at headlong speed,
and up the other side we panted. As we
neared where we believed the moose to be, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
slowed down in order to get my wind in case I
had to do some quick shooting. I soon picked
up the moose and managed to signal Willie
to stop. The moose was walking along at
the edge of the woods somewhat over two
hundred yards to our left. The wind was favorable,
so I decided to try to get nearer before
shooting. It was a mistake, for which I
came close to paying dearly; suddenly, and
without any warning, the great animal swung
into the woods and disappeared before I could
get ready to shoot.</p>

<p>Willie had his birch-bark horn with him and
he tried calling, but instead of coming toward
us, we could hear the moose moving off in the
other direction. The woods were dense, and
all chance seemed to have gone. With a
really good tracker, such as are to be found
among some of the African tribes, the task
would have been quite simple, but neither
Willie nor I was good enough. We had given
up hope when we heard the moose grunt on
the hillside above us. Hurrying toward the
sound, we soon came into more open country.
I saw him in a little glade to our right; he
looked most impressive as he stood there,
nearly nineteen hands at the withers, shaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
his antlers and staring at us; I dropped to
my knee and shot, and that was the first that
Willie knew of our quarry’s presence. He
didn’t go far after my first shot, but several
more were necessary before he fell. We hurried
up to examine him; he was not yet dead,
and when we were half a dozen yards away, he
staggered to his feet and started for us, but
he fell before he could reach us. Had I shot
him the first day I might have had some compunction
at having put an end to such a huge,
handsome animal, but as it was I had no such
feelings. We had hunted long and hard, and
luck had been consistently against us.</p>

<p>Our chase had led us back in a quartering
direction toward camp, which was now not
more than a mile away; so Willie went to
get Wirre, while I set to work to take the
measurements and start on the skinning.
Taking off a whole moose hide is no light task,
and it was well after dark before we got it
off. We estimated the weight of the green
hide as well over a hundred and fifty pounds,
but probably less than two hundred. We
bundled it up as well as we could in some
pack-straps, and as I seemed best suited to the
task, I fastened it on my back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>The sun had gone down, and that mile back
to camp, crawling over dead falls and tripping
on stones, was one of the longest I have ever
walked. The final descent down the almost
perpendicular hillside was the worst. When
I fell, the skin was so heavy and such a clumsy
affair that I couldn’t get up alone unless I
could find a tree to help me; but generally
Willie would start me off again. When I
reached the cabin, in spite of the cold night-air,
my clothes were as wet as if I had been in
swimming. After they had taken the skin off
my shoulders, I felt as if I had nothing to
hold me down to earth, and might at any
moment go soaring into the air.</p>

<p>Next morning I packed the skin down to
the main camp, about three miles, but I found
it a much easier task in the daylight. After
working for a while on the skin, I set off to
look for a cow moose, but, as is always the
case, where they had abounded before, there
was none to be found now that we wanted
one.</p>

<p>The next day we spent tramping over the
barren hillsides after caribou. Willie caught a
glimpse of one, but it disappeared into a pine
forest before we could come up with it. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the way back to camp I shot a deer for meat on
our way down the river.</p>

<p>I had determined to have one more try for
a cow moose, and next morning was just
going off to hunt some lakes when we caught
sight of an old cow standing on the opposite
bank of the river about half a mile above us.
We crossed and hurried up along the bank,
but when we reached the bog where she had
been standing she had disappeared. There
was a lake not far from the river-bank, and we
thought that she might have gone to it, for
we felt sure we had not frightened her. As
we reached the lake we saw her standing at
the edge of the woods on the other side, half
hidden in the trees. I fired and missed, but as
she turned to make off I broke her hind quarter.
After going a little distance she circled
back to the lake and went out to stand in the
water. We portaged a canoe from the river
and took some pictures before finishing the
cow. At the point where she fell the banks of
the lake were so steep that we had to give
up the attempt to haul the carcass out. I
therefore set to work to get the skin off where
the cow lay in the water. It was a slow, cold
task, but finally I finished and we set off downstream,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
Wirre in one canoe and Willie and myself
in the other. According to custom, the
moose head was laid in the bow of our canoe,
with the horns curving out on either side.</p>

<p>We had been in the woods for almost a
month, and in that time we had seen the
glorious changes from summer to fall and fall
to early winter, for the trees were leafless and
bare. Robinson’s lines kept running through
my head as we sped downstream through the
frosty autumn day:</p>

TWO BOOK-HUNTERS IN SOUTH
AMERICA</h2>
<p class="pfs120 pb2"><em>In Collaboration with Mrs. Kermit Roosevelt</em></p>
</div>


<p>The true bibliophile will always find time
to exercise his calling, no matter where he
happens to be, or in what manner he is engaged
in making his daily bread. In some
South American cities, more particularly in
Buenos Ayres, there is so little to do outside
of one’s office that were there more old bookstores
it would be what Eugene Field would
have called a bibliomaniac’s paradise. To
us wanderers on the face of the earth serendipity
in its more direct application to book-collecting
is a most satisfactory pursuit; for it
requires but little capital, and in our annual
flittings to “somewhere else” our purchases
necessitate but the minimum of travelling
space. There are two classes of bibliophiles&mdash;those
to whom the financial side is of little or
no consequence, and those who, like the clerk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of the East India House, must count their
pennies, and save, and go without other things
to counterbalance an extravagance in the purchase
of a coveted edition. To the former
class these notes may seem overworldly in
their frequent allusion to prices; but to its
authors the financial side must assume its
relative importance.</p>

<p>Among the South American republics, Brazil
undeniably takes precedence from a literary
standpoint. Most Brazilians, from Lauro Muller,
the minister of foreign affairs, to the postmaster
of the little frontier town, have at some
period in their lives published, or at all events
written, a volume of prose or verse. It comes
to them from their natural surroundings, and
by inheritance, for once you except Cervantes,
the Portuguese have a greater literature than
the Spaniards. There is therefore in Brazil
an excellent and widely read native literature,
and in almost every home there are to be found
the works of such poets as Gonçalves Diaz and
Castro Alves, and historians, novelists, and
essayists like Taunay, Couto de Magalhãens,
Alencar, and Coelho Netto. Taunay’s most famous
novel, <cite>Innocencia</cite>, a tale of life in the
frontier state of Matto Grosso&mdash;“the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
wilderness”&mdash;has been translated into seven
languages, including the Japanese and Polish.
The literature of the mother country is also
generally known; Camões is read in the schools,
and a quotation from the Lusiads is readily
capped by a casual acquaintance in the remotest
wilderness town. Portuguese poets
and playwrights like Almeda Garret, Bocage,
Quental and Guerra Junquera; and historians
and novelists such as Herculano, Eça de
Queiroz, or Castello Branco are widely read.</p>

<p>In Brazil, as throughout South America,
French is almost universally read; cheap editions
of the classics are found in most homes,
and bookstores are filled with modern French
writers of prose or verse&mdash;sometimes in translation,
and as frequently in the original. Rio
de Janeiro and São Paulo abound in old bookstores,
which are to be found in fewer numbers
in others of the larger towns, such as Manaos,
Para, Pernambuco, Bahia, Curytiba, or Porto
Alegre. In the smaller towns of the interior
one runs across only new books, although occasionally
those who possess the “flaire” may
chance upon some battered treasure.</p>

<p>The line which is of most interest, and in
South America presents the greatest latitude,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
is undoubtedly that of early voyages and discoveries.
Probably it was because they were
in a greater or less degree voyagers or explorers
themselves that the Americans and English
who came to South America seventy or eighty
years ago brought with them books of exploration
and travel, both contemporary and ancient.
Many of these volumes, now rare in
the mother country, are to be picked up for a
song in the old bookstores of the New World.</p>

<p>The accounts of the Conquistadores and
early explorers, now in the main inaccessible
except in great private collections or museums,
have frequently been reprinted, and if written
in a foreign tongue, translated, in the country
which they describe. Thus the account of
Père Yveux was translated and printed in
Maranhão in 1878, and this translation is now
itself rare. We picked up a copy for fifty
cents in a junk-store in Bahia, but in São Paulo
had to pay the market price for the less rare
translation of Hans Stade’s captivity. Ulrich
Schmidel’s entertaining account of the twenty
years of his life spent in the first half of the
sixteenth century in what is now Argentina,
Paraguay, and Brazil, has been excellently
translated into Spanish by an Argentine of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
French descent, Lafoyne Quevedo, the head of
the La Plata museum. We had never seen
the book until one day at the judicial auction
held by the heirs of a prominent Argentine
lawyer. Books published in Buenos Ayres
are as a whole abominably printed, but this
was really beautiful, so we determined to get
it. The books were being sold in ill-assorted
lots, and this one was with three other volumes;
one was an odd volume of Italian poetry, one
a religious treatise, and the third a medical
book. Bidding had been low, and save for
standard legal books, the lots had been going
at two or three dollars apiece. Our lot quickly
went to five dollars. There was soon only one
man bidding against us. We could not understand
what he wanted, but thought that perhaps
the Schmidel was worth more than we
had imagined. Our blood was up and we began
trying to frighten our opponent by substantial
raises; at fourteen he dropped out.
The dealers in common with every one else were
much intrigued at the high bidding, and clearly
felt that something had escaped them. The
mystery was solved when our opponent hurried
over to ask what we wanted for the odd volume
of Italian verse&mdash;it belonged to him and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
had loaned it to the defunct lawyer shortly
before his death. We halved the expenses
and the lot, and, as a curious sequel, later found
that the medical book which had quite accidentally
fallen to our share was worth between
fifteen and twenty dollars.</p>

<p>Prices in Brazil seemed very high in comparison
with those of Portugal and Spain,
but low when compared with Argentina. On
the west coast we found books slightly less
expensive than in Brazil, where, however, the
prices have remained the same as before the
war, though the drop in exchange has given
the foreigner the benefit of a twenty-five per
cent reduction. There are a fair number of
auctions, and old books are also sold through
priced lists, published in the daily papers. We
obtained our best results by search in the
bookshops. It was in this way that we got
for three dollars the first edition of Castelleux’s
<cite>Voyage dans la Partie Septentrionale de l’Amerique</cite>,
in perfect condition, and for one dollar
Jordan’s <cite>Guerra do Paraguay</cite>, for which a bookseller
in Buenos Ayres had asked, as a tremendous
bargain, twelve dollars.</p>

<p>In São Paulo after much searching we found
Santos Saraiva’s paraphrase of the Psalms, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
famous translation, quite as beautiful as our
own English version. The translator was born
in Lisbon. His father was a Jewish rabbi, but
he entered the Catholic Church, became a
priest, and went to an inland parish in southern
Brazil. After some years he left the Church
and settled down with a Brazilian woman in
a small, out-of-the-way fazenda, where he
translated the Psalms, and also composed a
Greek lexicon that is regarded as a masterpiece.
He later became instructor in Greek in Mackenzie
College in São Paulo, confining his versatile
powers to that institution until he died.</p>

<p>The dearth of native literature in Buenos
Ayres is not surprising, for nature has done
little to stimulate it, and in its fertility much
to create the commercialism that reigns supreme.
The country is in large part rolling
prairie-land, and although there is an attraction
about it in its wild state, which has called
forth a gaucho literature that chiefly takes
form in long and crude ballads, the magic of
the prairie-land is soon destroyed by houses,
factories, dump-heaps, and tin cans. At first
sight it would appear hopeless ground for a
bibliophile, but with time and patience we
found a fair number of old bookstores; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
there rarely passes a week without a book
auction, or at any rate an auction where some
books are put up.</p>

<p>Among the pleasantest memories of our life
in Buenos Ayres are those of motoring in to a
sale from our house in Belgrano, along the
famous Avenida Alvear, on starlit nights, with
the Southern Cross high and brilliant. Occasionally
when the books we were interested in
were far between, we would slip out of the
smoke-laden room for a cup of unrivalled coffee
at the Café Paulista, or to watch Charlie
Chaplin as “Carlitos” amuse the Argentine
public.</p>

<p>The great percentage of the books one sees
at auctions or in bookstores are strictly utilitarian;
generally either on law or medicine.
In the old bookstores there are, as in Boston,
rows of religious books, on which the dust lies
undisturbed. In Argentine literature there
are two or three famous novels; most famous
of these is probably Marmol’s <cite>Amalia</cite>, a bloodthirsty
and badly written story of the reign of
Rosas&mdash;the gaucho Nero. Bunge’s <cite>Novela de
la Sangre</cite> is an excellently given but equally
lurid account of the same period. <cite>La Gloria
de Don Ramiro</cite>, by Rodriguez Larreta, is a well-written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
tale of the days of Philip the Second.
The author, the present Argentine minister
in Paris, spent some two years in Spain studying
the local setting of his romance. Most
Argentines, if they have not read these novels,
at least know the general plots and the more
important characters. The literature of the
mother country is little read and as a rule
looked down upon by the Argentines, who are
more apt to read French or even English.
<cite>La Nacion</cite>, which is one of the two great morning
papers, and owned by a son of Bartholomé
Mitre, publishes a cheap uniform edition,
which is formed of some Argentine reprints
and originals, but chiefly of French and English
translations. The latest publication is advertised
on the front page of the newspaper, and
one often runs across “old friends” whose
“new faces” cause a momentary check to the
memory; such as <cite>La Feria de Vanidades</cite>, the
identity of which is clear when one reads that
the author is Thackeray. This “Biblioteca
de la Nacion” is poorly got up and printed on
wretched paper, but seems fairly widely read,
and will doubtless stimulate the scarcely existent
literary side of the Argentine, and in due
time bear fruit. Translations of Nick Carter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
and the “penny dreadfuls” are rife, but a native
writer, Gutierrez, who wrote in the seventies
and eighties, created a national hero,
Juan Moreira, who was a benevolent Billy the
Kid. Gutierrez wrote many “dramas policiales,”
which are well worth reading for the
light they throw in their side touches on
“gaucho” life of those days.</p>

<p>Argentines are justifiably proud of Bartholomé
Mitre, their historian soldier, who was
twice president; and of Sarmiento, essayist
and orator, who was also president, and who
introduced the educational reforms whose application
he had studied in the United States.
At an auction in New York we secured a presentation
copy of his <cite>Vida de Lincoln</cite>, written
and published in this country in 1866. Mitre
first published his history of General Belgrano,
of revolutionary fame, in two volumes in 1859.
It has run through many editions; the much-enlarged
one in four volumes is probably more
universally seen in private houses than any
other Argentine book. The first edition is
now very rare and worth between forty and
fifty dollars; but in a cheap Italian stationery-store
we found a copy in excellent condition
and paid for it only four dollars and fifty cents.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
The edition of 1887 brings anywhere from
twenty to thirty dollars. Many copies were
offered at sales, but we delayed in hopes of a
better bargain, and one night our patience
was rewarded. It was at the fag end of a
private auction of endless rooms of cheap and
tawdry furniture that the voluble auctioneer
at length reached the contents of the solitary
bookcase. Our coveted copy was knocked
down to us at eight dollars.</p>

<p>In native houses one very rarely finds what
we would even dignify by the name of library.
Generally a fair-sized bookcase of ill-assorted
volumes is regarded as such. There are, however,
excellent legal and medical collections to
be seen, and Doctor Moreno’s colonial quinta,
with its well-filled shelves, chiefly volumes of
South American exploration and development
from the earliest times, forms a marked exception&mdash;an
oasis in the desert. We once went
to stay in the country with some Argentines,
who seeing us arrive with books in our hands,
proudly offered the use of their library, to
which we had often heard their friends make
reference. For some time we were greatly
puzzled as to the location of this much-talked-of
collection, and were fairly staggered on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
having a medium-sized bookcase, half of which
was taken up by a set of excerpts from the
“world’s great thinkers and speakers,” in
French, pointed out as “the library.”</p>

<p>As a rule the first thing a family will part
with is its books. There are two sorts of auctions&mdash;judicial
and booksellers’. The latter
class are held by dealers who are having bad
times and hope to liquidate some of their stock,
but there are always cappers in the crowd
who keep bidding until a book is as high and
often higher than its market price. The majority
of the books are generally legal or medical;
and there is always a good number of
young students who hope to get reference books
cheaply. Most of the books are in Spanish,
but there is a sprinkling of French, and often
a number of English, German, and Portuguese,
though these last are no more common in Argentina
than are Spanish books in Brazil.
At one auction there were a number of Portuguese
lots which went for far more than they
would have brought in Rio or São Paulo.
Translations from the Portuguese are infrequent;
the only ones we can recall were of
Camões and Eça de Queiroz. In Brazil the
only translation from Spanish we met with was
of <cite>Don Quixote</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>English books generally go reasonably at
auctions. We got a copy of Page’s <cite>Paraguay
and the River Plate</cite> for twenty-five cents, but
on another occasion had some very sharp bidding
for Wilcox’s <cite>History of Our Colony in the
River Plate</cite>, London, 1807, written during the
brief period when Buenos Ayres was an English
possession. It was finally knocked down to us
at twelve dollars; and after the auction our
opponent offered us twice what he had let us
have it for; we don’t yet know what it is
worth. The question of values is a difficult
one, for there is little or no data to go upon;
in consequence, the element of chance is very
considerable. From several sources in the
book world, we heard a wild and most improbable
tale of how Quaritch and several
other London houses had many years ago sent
a consignment of books to be auctioned in the
Argentine; and that the night of the auction
was so cold and disagreeable that the exceedingly
problematical buyers were still further
reduced. The auction was held in spite of
conditions, and rare incunabula are reported
to have gone at a dollar apiece.</p>

<p>There was one judicial auction that lasted
for the best part of a week&mdash;the entire stock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
of a large bookstore that had failed. They
were mostly new books, and such old ones as
were of any interest were interspersed in lots
of ten or more of no value. The attendance
was large and bidding was high. To get the
few books we wanted we had also to buy a
lot of waste material; but when we took this
to a small and heretofore barren bookstore to
exchange, we found a first edition of the three
first volumes of <cite>Kosmos</cite>, for which, with a number
of Portuguese and Spanish books thrown
in, we made the exchange. We searched long
and without success for the fourth volume,
but as the volumes were published at long
intervals, it is probable that the former owner
had only possessed the three.</p>

<p>Our best finds were made not at auctions
but in bookstores&mdash;often in little combination
book, cigar, and stationery shops. We happened
upon one of these latter one Saturday
noon on our way to lunch at a little
Italian restaurant, where you watched your
chicken being most deliciously roasted on a
spit before you. Chickens were forgotten,
and during two hours’ breathless hunting we
found many good things, among them a battered
old copy of Byron’s poems, which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
long since lost its binding. Pasted in it was
the following original letter of Byron’s, which
as far as we know has never before been published:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: In various numbers of your journal I have
seen mentioned a work entitled <cite>The Vampire</cite>, with the
addition of my name as that of the author. I am not
the author, and never heard of the work in question until
now. In a more recent paper I perceive a formal annunciation
of <cite>The Vampire</cite>, with the addition of an account
of my “residence in the Island of Mitylane,” an
island which I have occasionally sailed by in the course
of travelling some years ago through the Levant&mdash;and
where I should have no objection to reside&mdash;but where I
have never yet resided. Neither of these performances
are mine&mdash;and I presume that it is neither unjust nor
ungracious to request that you will favour me by contradicting
the advertisement to which I allude. If the
book is clever, it would be base to deprive the real
writer&mdash;whoever he may be&mdash;of his honours&mdash;and if
stupid I desire the responsibility of nobody’s dulness but
my own. You will excuse the trouble I give you&mdash;the
imputation is of no great importance&mdash;and as long as
it was confined to surmises and reports&mdash;I should have
received it as I have received many others&mdash;in silence.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>But the formality of a public advertisement of a book
I never wrote, and a residence where I never resided&mdash;is
a little too much&mdash;particularly as I have no notion of
the contents of the one&mdash;nor the incidents of the other.
I have besides a personal dislike to “vampires,” and the
little acquaintance I have with them would by no means
induce me to divulge their secrets. You did me a much
less injury by your paragraphs about “my devotion”
and “abandonment of society for the sake of religion”&mdash;which
appeared in your <cite>Messenger</cite> during last Lent&mdash;all
of which are not founded on fact&mdash;but you see I
do not contradict them, because they are merely personal,
whereas the others in some degree concern the
reader....</p>

<p>You will oblige me by complying with my request for
contradiction. I assure you that I know nothing of the
work or works in question&mdash;and have the honour to be
(as the correspondents to magazines say) “your constant
reader” and very</p>

<p>To the editor of <cite>Galignani’s Messenger</cite>. Etc., etc., etc.
Venice, April 27, 1819.</p></div>

<p>Curiously enough, the book itself had been
published by Galignani in 1828. The cost of
our total purchases, a goodly heap, amounted
to but five dollars.</p>

<p>The balance in quantity if not in quality
in old books is held in Buenos Ayres by three
brothers named Palumbo&mdash;Italians. The eldest
is a surly old man who must be treated with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
severity from the very beginning. How he
manages to support himself we do not know,
for whenever we were in his store we were sure
to hear him assail some customer most abusively.
In a small subsidiary store of his,
among a heap of old pamphlets, we came upon
the original folios of Humboldt’s account of
the fauna and flora of South America. Upon
asking the price, the man said thirty-five apiece&mdash;we
thought he meant pesos, and our surprise
was genuine when we found he meant
centavos&mdash;about fifteen cents. From him we
got the first edition of Kendall’s <cite>Santa Fé Expedition</cite>.
One of his brothers was very pleasant
and probably, in consequence, the most prosperous
of the three. The third was reputed
crazy, and certainly acted so, but after an
initial encounter we became friends and got on
famously. All three had a very fair idea of
the value of Argentine books, but knew little
or nothing about English.</p>

<p>Another dealer who has probably a better
stock than any of the Palumbos is a man
named Real y Taylor. His grandmother was
English, and his father spent his life dealing in
books. At his death the store was closed and
the son started speculating in land with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
money his father had left him. Prices soared
and he bought, but when the crash came he
was caught with many others. Bethinking
himself of his father’s books, he took them out
of storage and opened a small booth. The
stock was large and a good part of it has not
yet been unpacked. Taylor has only a superficial
knowledge of what he deals in. He shears
folios, strips off original boards and old leathers
to bind in new pasteboard, and raises the price
five or ten dollars after the process. In this
he is no different from the rest, for after a fairly
comprehensive experience in Buenos Ayres
we may give it as our opinion that there is not
a single dealer who knows the “rules” as they
are observed by scores of dealers in America
and England. Taylor had only one idea, and
that was that if any one were interested in a
book, that book must be of great value; he
would name a ridiculous price, and it was a
question of weeks and months before he would
reduce it to anything within the bounds of
reason. We never really got very much from
him, the best things being several old French
books of early voyages to South America and
a first edition of Anson’s <cite>Voyage Around the
World</cite>. Just before we left he decided to auction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
off his stock, putting up five hundred
lots a month. The first auction lasted three
nights. The catalogue was amusing, giving a
description of each book in bombastic fashion&mdash;all
were “unique in interest,” and about
every third was the “only copy extant outside
the museums.” He had put base prices on
most, and for the rest had arranged with
cappers. The attendance was very small and
nearly everything was bid in. It was curious
to see how to the last he held that any book
that any one was interested in must be of
unusual worth. There was put up a French
translation of Azara’s <cite>Quadrupeds of Paraguay</cite>.
The introduction was by Cuvier, but it was
not of great interest to us, for a friend had
given us the valuable original Spanish edition.
Taylor had asked fifteen dollars, which we had
regarded as out of the question; he then took
off the original binding, cut and colored the
pages, and rebound it, asking twenty dollars.
At the auction we thought we would get it,
if it went for very little; but when we bid,
Taylor got up and told the auctioneer to say
that as it was a work of unique value he had
put as base price fifteen dollars each for the
two volumes. The auction was a failure, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
as it had been widely and expensively advertised,
the loss must have been considerable.</p>

<p>As a whole, we found the booksellers of
a disagreeable temperament. In one case we
almost came to blows; luckily not until we
had looked over the store thoroughly and
bought all we really wanted, among them a
first edition of Howells’s <cite>Italian Journeys</cite>, in
perfect condition, for twenty-five cents. There
were, of course, agreeable exceptions, such as
the old French-Italian from whom, after many
months’ intermittent bargaining, we bought Le
Vaillant’s <cite>Voyage en Afrique</cite>, the first edition,
with most delightful steel-engravings. He at
first told us he was selling it at a set price
on commission, which is what we found they
often said when they thought you wanted a
book and wished to preclude bargaining. This
old man had Amsterdam catalogues that he
consulted in regard to prices when, as could
not have been often the case, he found in them
references to books he had in stock. We know
of no Argentine old bookstore that prints a
catalogue.</p>

<p>In the larger provincial cities of Argentina
we met with singularly little success. In
Cordoba the only reward of an eager search<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
was a battered paper-covered copy of <cite>All on
the Irish Shore</cite>, with which we were glad to
renew an acquaintance that had lapsed for
several years. We had had such high hopes of
Cordoba, as being the old university town and
early centre of learning! There was indeed
one trail that seemed to promise well, and we
diligently pursued vague stories of a “viejo”
who had trunks of old books in every language,
but when we eventually found his rooms,
opening off a dirty little patio, they were empty
and bereft; and we learned from a grimy brood
of children that he had gone to the hospital
in Buenos Ayres and died there, and that his
boxes had been taken away by they knew not
whom.</p>

<p>As in Argentina, the best-known Chilian
writers are historians or lawyers; and in our
book-hunts in Santiago we encountered more
or less the same conditions that held in Buenos
Ayres&mdash;shelf upon shelf of legal or medical
reference books and technical treatises. The
works of certain well-known historians, such as
Vicuña Mackenna and Amonategui, consistently
command relatively high prices; but,
as a whole, books are far cheaper on the west
side of the Andes. One long afternoon in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the Calle San Diego stands out. It was a
rich find, but we feel that the possibilities of
that store are still unexhausted. That afternoon’s
trove included the first edition of
Mungo Park’s <cite>Travels</cite>, with the delightful
original etchings; a <cite>History of Guatemala</cite>,
written by the Dominican missionaries, published
in 1619, an old leather-bound folio, in
excellent shape; a first edition of Holmes’s
<cite>Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table</cite> and three of
the eight volumes of <cite>State Papers and Publick
Documents of the United States</cite>. In these last
there was James Monroe’s book-plate, and it
was curious to imagine how these volumes
from his library had found their way to a country
where his “doctrine” has been the subject
of such bitter discussion and so much misinterpretation.
The value of the original covers
was no more understood in Chile than in Argentina,
and we got a complete set of Vicuña
Mackenna’s <cite>Campaña de Tacna</cite> in the original
pamphlets, as published, for but half what
was currently asked for bound and mutilated
copies.</p>

<p>Valparaiso proved a barren field, and although
one of the chief delights in book-hunting
lies in the fact that you can never feel that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
you have completely exhausted the possibilities
of a place, we came nearer to feeling that way
about Valparaiso than we ever had about a
town before. We found but one store that
gave any promise, and from it all we got were
the first seven volumes of Dickens’s <cite>Household
Words</cite> in perfect condition, and the <cite>Campaign
of the Rapidan</cite>.</p>

<p>The little coast towns of Chile and Peru
are almost as barren as the desert rocks and
sand-hills that surround them; but even here
we had occasional surprises, as when we
picked up for fifty cents, at Antofogasta, a
desolate, thriving little mining-port in the
north of Chile, Vicuña Mackenna’s <cite>Life of
O’Higgins</cite>, for which the current price is from
ten to fifteen dollars. Another time, in Coquimbo,
we saw a man passing along the street
with a hammered-copper bowl that we coveted,
and following, we found him the owner of a
junk-shop filled with a heterogeneous collection
of old clothes, broken and battered furniture,
horse-trappings, and a hundred and one odds
and ends, among which were scattered some
fifty or sixty books. One of these was a first
edition of Hawthorne’s <cite>Twice-Told Tales</cite> in
the familiar old brown boards of Ticknor &amp;
Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Our South American book-hunting ended in
Lima, the entrancing old city of the kings,
once the capital of the New World, and not
yet robbed by this commercial age of all its
glamour and backwardness. We expected
much, knowing that when the Chilians occupied
the city in 1880 they sacked the national
library of fifty thousand volumes that their
own liberator, San Martin, had founded in
1822, and although many of the books were
carried off to Chile, the greater part was scattered
around Lima or sold by weight on the
streets. We shall always feel that with more
time, much patience, and good luck we could
have unearthed many treasures; although at
first sight the field is not a promising one, and,
as elsewhere, one’s acquaintances assure one
that there is nothing to be found. In spite of
this, however, we came upon a store that appeared
teeming with possibilities. Without
the “flaire” or much luck it might be passed
by many times without exciting interest.
Over the dingy grated window of a dilapidated
colonial house is the legend “Encuadernacion
y Imprenta” (“Binding and Printing.”)
Through the grimy window-panes may be seen
a row of dull law-books; but if you open the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
big gate and cross the patio, with its ancient
hand-well in the centre, on the opposite side
are four or five rooms with shelves of books
along the walls and tottering and fallen piles
of books scattered over the floor. Here we
picked up among others an amusing little old
vellum-covered edition of Horace, printed in
England in 1606, which must have early found
its way to South America, to judge from the
Spanish scrawls on the title-page. We also
got many of the works of Ricardo Palma,
Peru’s most famous writer, who built up the
ruined national library, which now possesses
some sixty thousand volumes, of which a
twelfth part were donated by our own Smithsonian
Institution. One of the volumes we
bought had been given by Palma to a friend,
and had an autograph dedication which in
other countries would have greatly enhanced
its value, but which, curiously enough, seems
to make no difference in South America. In
Buenos Ayres we got a copy of the <cite>Letters from
Europe</cite> of Campos Salles, Brazil’s greatest
president, which had been inscribed by him to
the Argentine translator. Once in São Paulo
we picked up an autographed copy of Gomes
de Amorim, and in neither case did the autograph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
enter into the question of determining
the price.</p>

<p>We had heard rumors of possibilities in
store for us in Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela,
but Lima was our “farthest north,”
for there our ramblings in South America were
reluctantly brought to a close. We feel, however,
that such as they were, and in spite of
the fact that the names of many of the authors
and places will be strange to our brethren who
have confined their explorations to the northern
hemisphere, these notes may awaken interest
in a little-known field, which, if small in comparison
with America or the Old World, offers
at times unsuspected prizes and rewards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI<br />
SETH BULLOCK&mdash;SHERIFF OF THE<br />
BLACK HILLS COUNTRY</h2>
</div>


<p>With the death of Captain Seth Bullock, of
Deadwood, South Dakota, there came to us
who were his friends not only a deep sense of
personal loss, but also the realization that one
of the very last of the old school of frontiersmen
had gone, one of those whom Lowell characterized
as “stern men with empires in their
brains.” The hard hand of circumstance
called forth and developed the type, and for
a number of generations the battle with the
wilderness continued in bitter force, and a race
was brought forth trained to push on far beyond
the “edge of cultivation,” and contend in
his remote fastnesses with the Red Indian, and
eke out a hard-earned existence from the grim
and resentful wilds. In the wake of the vanguard
came the settler and after him the merchant,
and busy towns sprang up where the
lonely camp-fire of the pioneer had flared to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the silent forest. The restless blood of the
frontiers pressed ever onward; the Indian
melted away like “snow upon the desert’s dusty
face”; the great herds of game that formerly
blackened the plains left the mute testimony
of their passing in the scattered piles of
whitened skulls and bleached bones. At last
the time came when there was no further frontier
to conquer. The restless race of empire-makers
had staring them in the face the same
fate as the Indian. Their rough-and-ready
justice administered out of hand had to give
way before the judge with his court-house and
his jury. The majority of the old Indian
fighters were shouldered aside and left to end
their days as best they could, forgotten by
those for whom they had won the country.
They could not adapt themselves to the new
existence; their day had passed and they went
to join the Indian and the buffalo.</p>

  <div class="caption">The Captain makes advances to a little Indian girl</div>
</div>

<p>Captain Seth Bullock, however, belonged to
the minority, for no turn of the wheel could
destroy his usefulness to the community, and
his large philosophy of the plains enabled him
to fit into and hold his place through every
shift of surroundings. The Captain’s family
came from Virginia, but he was born in Windsor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Ontario, in 1849. Before he was twenty
he had found his way to Montana, and built
for himself a reputation for justice which at
that day and in that community could only be
established by cold and dauntless courage.</p>

<p>One of the feats of his early days of
which he was justly proud was when he had
himself hung the first man to be hung by law
in Montana. The crowd of prospectors and
cow-punchers did not approve of such an unusual,
unorthodox method of procedure as the
hanging of a man by a public hangman after
he had been duly tried and sentenced. They
wished to take the prisoner and string him up
to the nearest tree or telegraph-pole, with the
readiness and despatch to which they were
accustomed. To evidence their disapproval
they started to shoot at the hangman; he fled,
but before the crowd could secure their victim,
the Captain had the mastery of the situation,
and, quieting his turbulent fellow citizens with
a cold eye and relentless six-shooter, he himself
performed the task that the hangman had
left unfinished. The incident inspired the
mob with a salutary respect for the law and
its ability to carry out its sentences. I do not
remember whether the Captain was mayor or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
sheriff at the time. He was trusted and admired
as well as feared, and when he was
barely twenty-two he was elected State senator
from Helena, the largest town in the then
territory of Montana.</p>

<p>It was in 1876 that the Captain first went
to the Black Hills, that lovely group of mountains
in the southwestern corner of South
Dakota. He came with the first rush of
prospectors when the famous Hidden Treasure
Mine was discovered. On the site of what is
at present the town of Deadwood he set up a
store for miners’ supplies, and soon had established
himself as the arm of the law in that
very lawless community. That was the Captain’s
rôle all through his life. In the early
years he would spend day and night in the
saddle in pursuit of rustlers and road-agents.
When he once started on the trail nothing
could make him relinquish it; and when he
reached the end, his quarry would better surrender
without drawing. He had a long arm
and his district was known throughout the
West as an unhealthy place for bad men.
Starting as federal peace officer of the Black
Hills, he later became marshal and sheriff of
the district, and eventually marshal of South<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Dakota, which position he held until 1914.
As years passed and civilization advanced,
his bag of malefactors became less simple in
character, although maintaining some of the
old elements. In 1908 he wrote me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been very busy lately; pulled two horse thieves
from Montana last week for stealing horses from the
Pine Ridge Indians. I leave to-day for Leavenworth
with a bank cashier for mulling a bank. He may turn
up on Wall Street when his term expires, to take a post
graduate course.</p></div>

<p>In 1907 he told me that he was going off
among the Ute Indians, and I asked him to
get me some of their pipes. He answered:
“The Utes are not pipe-makers; they spend
all their time rustling and eating government
grub. We had six horse-thieves for the pen
after the past term of court, and should get
four more at the June term in Pierre. This
will keep them quiet for a while. I am now
giving my attention to higher finance, and
have one of the Napoleons&mdash;a bank president&mdash;in
jail here. He only got away with $106,000&mdash;he
did not have time to become eligible
for the Wall Street class.”</p>

<p>It was when the Captain was sheriff of the
Black Hills that father first met him. A horse-thief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
that was “wanted” in the Deadwood district
managed to slip out of the Captain’s
clutches and was captured by father, who was
deputy sheriff in a country three or four hundred
miles north. A little while later father
had to go to Deadwood on business. Fording
a river some miles out of town he ran into the
Captain. Father had often heard of Seth Bullock,
for his record and character were known
far and wide, and he had no difficulty in identifying
the tall, slim, hawk-featured Westerner
sitting his horse like a centaur. Seth Bullock,
however, did not know so much about father,
and was very suspicious of the rough, unkempt
group just in from two weeks’ sleeping out in
the gumbo and sage-brush. He made up his
mind that it was a tin-horn gambling outfit
and would bear close watching. He was not
sure but what it would be best to turn them
right back, and let them walk around his district
“like it was a swamp.” After settling
father’s identity the Captain’s suspicions vanished.
That was the beginning of their lifelong
friendship.</p>

<p>After father had returned to the East to live,
Seth Bullock would come on to see him every
so often, and whenever my father’s campaigning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
took him West the Captain would join the
train and stay with him until the trip was
finished. These tours were rarely without incident,
and in his autobiography father has
told of the part Seth Bullock played on one of
them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When, in 1900, I was nominated for Vice-President,
I was sent by the National Committee on a trip into
the States of the high plains and the Rocky Mountains.
These had all gone overwhelmingly for Mr. Bryan on
the free-silver issue four years previously, and it was
thought that I, because of my knowledge of and acquaintanceship
with the people, might accomplish something
toward bringing them back into line. It was an
interesting trip, and the monotony usually attendant
upon such a campaign of political speaking was diversified
in vivid fashion by occasional hostile audiences.
One or two of the meetings ended in riots. One meeting
was finally broken up by a mob; everybody fought so
that the speaking had to stop. Soon after this we reached
another town where we were told there might be trouble.
Here the local committee included an old and valued
friend, a “two-gun” man of repute, who was not in the
least quarrelsome, but who always kept his word. We
marched round to the local opera-house, which was
packed with a mass of men, many of them rather rough-looking.
My friend the two-gun man sat immediately
behind me, a gun on each hip, his arms folded, looking
at the audience; fixing his gaze with instant intentness
on any section of the house from which there came so
much as a whisper. The audience listened to me with
rapt attention. At the end, with a pride in my rhetorical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>powers which proceeded from a misunderstanding of
the situation, I remarked to the chairman: “I held that
audience well; there wasn’t an interruption.” To which
the chairman replied: “Interruption? Well, I guess
not! Seth had sent round word that if any son of a
gun peeped he’d kill him.” (<cite>Autobiography</cite>, p. 141.)</p></div>

<p>Father had the greatest admiration and
affection for the Captain. It was to him that
he was referring in his autobiography when
he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have sometimes been asked if Wister’s <cite>Virginian</cite> is
not overdrawn; why, one of the men I have mentioned
in this chapter was in all essentials the “Virginian” in
real life, not only in his force but in his charm.</p></div>

<p>When we were hunting in Africa father
decided that he would try to get Seth Bullock
to meet us in Europe at the end of the trip.
I remember father describing him to some of
our English friends in Khartoum, and saying:
“Seth Bullock is a true Westerner, the finest
type of frontiersman. He could handle himself
in any situation, and if I felt that I did
not wish him to meet any particular person,
the reflection would be entirely on the latter.”</p>

<p>The Captain wrote me that he was afraid he
could not meet us in London because of the
illness of one of his daughters, but matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
eventually worked out in such a way that he
was able to go over to England, and when he
met father there he said he felt like hanging
his Stetson on the dome of Saint Paul’s and
shooting it off, to show his exhilaration at the
reunion. He thoroughly enjoyed himself in
England, and while at bottom he was genuinely
appreciative of the Britisher, he could
not help poking sly fun at him. I remember
riding on a bus with him and hearing him
ask the conductor where this famous Picalilly
Street was. The conductor said: “You must
mean Piccadilly, sir.” The Captain entered
into a lengthy conversation with him, and with
an unmoved stolidity of facial expression that
no Red Indian could have bettered, referred
each time to “Picalilly,” and each time the
little bus conductor would interpose a “You
mean Piccadilly, sir,” with the dogged persistency
of his race.</p>

<p>The major-domos and lackeys at the Guildhall
and other receptions and the “beefeaters”
at the Tower were a never-failing source of
delight; he would try to picture them on a
bad pony in the cow country, and explain that
their costume would “make them the envy
of every Sioux brave at an Indian dog-dance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>When my sister and I were in Edinburgh,
the local guide who took us through the Castle
showed us an ancient gun, which instead of
being merely double-barrelled, possessed a
cluster of five or six barrels. With great
amusement he told us how an American to
whom he had been showing the piece a few
days previously had remarked that to be shot
at with that gun must be like taking a shower-bath.
A few questions served to justify the
conclusion we had immediately formed as to
identity of our predecessor.</p>

<p>The summer that I was fourteen father
shipped me off to the Black Hills for a camping
trip with Seth Bullock. I had often seen him
in the East, so the tall, spare figure and the
black Stetson were familiar to me when the
Captain boarded the train a few stations before
reaching Deadwood. Never shall I forget the
romance of that first trip in the West. It was
all new to me. Unfortunately I had to leave
for the East for the start of school before the
opening of the deer season; but we caught a
lot of trout, and had some unsuccessful bear-hunts&mdash;hunts
which were doomed to unsuccess
before they started, but which supplied the
requisite thrill notwithstanding. All we ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
found of the bear was their tracks, but we had
a fleeting glimpse of a bobcat, and that was
felt amply to repay any amount of tramping.
Our bag consisted of one jack-rabbit. The
Captain told us that we were qualified to join
a French trapper whom he had known. The
Frenchman was caught by an unusually early
winter and snowed in away off in the hills.
In the spring, a good deal to every one’s surprise,
he turned up, looking somewhat thin,
but apparently totally unconcerned over his
forced hibernation. When asked what he had
lived on, he replied: “Some day I keel two
jack-rabeet, one day one, one day none!”</p>

<p>The Captain and I took turns at writing my
diary. I find his entry for August 26:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Broke camp at Jack Boyden’s on Sand Creek at 6.30
<span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, and rode via Redwater Valley and Hay Creek to
Belle Fourche, arriving at the S. B. ranch at two o’clock;
had lunch of cold cabbage; visited the town; returned
to camp at five <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>; had supper at the wagon and
fought mosquitoes until ten o’clock.</p>

<p>Broke camp and rode via Owl Creek divide and Indian
Creek through several very large towns inhabited
chiefly by prairie dogs, to our camp on Porcupine Creek.
Fought mosquitoes from 3 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> to breakfast time.</p></div>

<p>I had long been an admirer of Bret Harte,
and many of the people I met might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
stepped from the pages of his stories. There
was the old miner with twenty-two children,
who couldn’t remember all their names. His
first wife had presented him with ten of them,
but when he married again he had told his
second wife that it was his initial venture in
matrimony. He gave a vivid description of
the scene when some of the progeny of his first
marriage unexpectedly put in an appearance.
Time had smoothed things over, and the knowledge
of her predecessor had evidently only acted
as a spur to greater deeds, as exemplified
in the twelve additions to the family.</p>

<p>Then there was the old lady with the vinegar
jug. She was the postmistress of Buckhorn.
We had some difficulty in finding the
post-office, but at length we learned that the
postmistress had moved it fifteen miles away,
to cross the State border, in order that she
might live in Wyoming and have a vote. We
reached the shack to find it deserted, but we
had not long to wait before she rode in, purple
in the face and nearly rolling off her pony
from laughter. She told us that she had got
some vinegar from a friend, and while she was
riding along the motion exploded the jug, and
the cork hit her in the head; what with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
noise and the blow she made sure the Indians
were after her, and rode for her life a couple
of miles before she realized what had happened.</p>

<p>What could have surpassed the names of the
trails along which we rode and the canyons in
which we camped? There was Hidden Treasure
Gulch and Calamity Hollow, and a score
more equally satisfying. That first trip was
an immense success, and all during the winter
that followed whenever school life became particularly
irksome I would turn to plans for the
expedition that we had scheduled for the next
summer.</p>

<p>When the time to leave for the West arrived
I felt like an old stager, and indulged for the
first time in the delight of getting out my
hunting outfit, deciding what I needed, and
supplementing my last summer’s rig with other
things that I had found would be useful. Like
all beginners I imagined that I required a lot
for which I had in reality no possible use.
Some men always set off festooned like Christmas-trees,
and lose half the pleasure of the
trip through trying to keep track of their belongings.
They have special candles, patented
lanterns, enormous jack-knives with a blade
to fulfil every conceivable purpose, rifles and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
revolvers and shotguns galore; almost anything
that comes under the classification of “it might
come in handy.” The more affluent hunter
varies only in the quality and not the quantity
of his “gadjets.” He usually has each
one neatly tucked away in a pigskin case.
The wise man, however, soon learns that although
anything may “come in handy” once
on a trip, you could even on that occasion
either get along without it or find a substitute
that would do almost as well. It is surprising
with what a very little one can make out perfectly
comfortably. This was a lesson which I
very quickly learned from the Captain.</p>

<p>The second trip that we took was from
Deadwood, South Dakota, to Medora, North
Dakota. I had never seen the country in
which father ranched, and Seth Bullock decided
to take me up along the trail that father
had been travelling when they met for the
first time.</p>

<p>We set off on Friday the 13th, and naturally
everything that happened was charged up to
that inauspicious day. We lost all our horses
the first night, and only succeeded in retrieving
a part of them. Thereafter it started in
raining, and the gumbo mud became all but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
impassable for the “chuck-wagon.” The mosquitoes
added to our misery, and I find in my
diary in the Captain’s handwriting a note to
the effect that “Paul shot three mosquitoes
with a six-shooter. Stanley missed with a
shotgun.”</p>

<p>The Captain was as stolid and unconcerned
as a Red Indian through every change of
weather. He had nicknamed me “Kim” from
Kipling’s tale, and after me he had named a
large black horse which he always rode. It
was an excellent animal with a very rapid
walk which proved the bane of my existence.
My pony, “Pickpocket,” had no pace that
corresponded, and to adapt himself was forced
to travel at a most infernal jiggle that was not
only exceedingly wearing but shook me round
so that the rain permeated in all sorts of crevices
which might reasonably have been expected to
prove water-tight. With the pride of a boy
on his second trip, I could not bring myself
to own up to my discomfort. If I had, the
Captain would have instantly changed his
pace; but it seemed a soft and un-Western
admission to make, so I suffered in external
silence, while inwardly heaping every insult I
could think of upon the Captain’s mount. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
were travelling long distances, so the gait was
rarely changed unless I made some excuse to
loiter behind, and then walked my pony in slow
and solitary comfort until the Captain was
almost out of sight, and it was time to press
into a lope which comfortably and far too
rapidly once more put me even with him.</p>

<p>The Captain was a silent companion; he
would ride along hour after hour, chewing a
long black cigar, in a silence broken only by
verses he would hum to himself. There was
one that went on interminably, beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I wonder if ever a cowboy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will be seen in those days long to come;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I wonder if ever an Indian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will be seen in that far bye-and-bye.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every now and then some butte would suggest
a reminiscence of the early days, and a
few skilfully directed questions would lure him
into a chain of anecdotes of the already vanished
border-life. He was continually coming
out with a quotation from some author with
whose writings I had never thought him acquainted.
Fishing in a Black Hills stream, I
heard him mutter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“So you heard the left fork of the Yuba</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As you stood on the banks of the Po.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>
<p>He had read much of Kipling’s prose and
poetry, but what he most often quoted were
the lines to Fighting Bob Evans.</p>

<p>In his house in Deadwood he had a good
library, the sort of one which made you feel
that the books had been selected to read and
enjoy, and not bought by the yard like window-curtains,
or any other furnishings thought
necessary for a house. Mrs. Bullock was president
of the “Women’s Literary Club,” and I
remember father being much impressed with
the work that she was doing.</p>

<p>As I have said before, the Captain was a man
whom changing conditions could not throw
to one side. He would anticipate the changes,
and himself take the lead in them, adapting
himself to the new conditions; you could count
upon finding him on top. He was very proud
of the fact that he had brought the first alfalfa
to the State, and showed me his land near
Belle Fourche, where he had planted the original
crop. Its success was immediate. He
said that he could not claim the credit of having
introduced potatoes, but an old friend of
his was entitled to the honor, and he delighted
in telling the circumstances. The Captain’s
friend, whom we can call Judge Jones, for I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
forgotten his name, had opened a trading-post
in what was at that time the wild territory of
Dakota. The Indians were distinctly hostile,
and at any good opportunity were ready to
raid the posts, murdering the factors and looting
the trading goods. In the judge’s territory
there was one particularly ugly customer,
half Indian and half negro, known as Nigger
Bill. The judge was much interested in the
success of his adventure in potatoes, and the
following was one of the letters he received
from his factor, as Seth Bullock used to quote
it to me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Judge</span>,</p>

<p>This is to tell you all is well here and I hope is same
with you. Nigger Bill came to the door of the stockade
to-day and said “I am going to get in.” I said “Nigger
Bill you will not get in.” Nigger Bill said “I will get
in.” I shot Nigger Bill. He is dead. The potatoes is
doing fine.</p></div>

<p>Although realizing to the full that the change
was inevitable and, of course, to the best interests
of the country, and naturally taking
much pride in the progress his State was making,
the Captain could not help at times feeling
a little melancholy over the departed days
when there was no wire in the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
one could ride where one listed. He wrote me
in 1911: “The part of South Dakota which
you knew has all been covered with the shacks
of homesteaders, from Belle Fourche to Medora,
and from the Cheyenne agency to the
Creek Where the Old Woman Died.” The old
times had gone, never to return, and although
the change was an advance, it closed an existence
that could never be forgotten or relived
by those who had taken part in it.</p>

<p>The Captain gave me very sound advice
when I was trying to make up my mind whether
or not to go to college. I was at the time
going through the period of impatience that
comes to so many boys when they feel that
they are losing valuable time, during which
they should be starting in to make their way
in the world. I had talked it over with the
Captain during one of the summer trips, and
soon afterward he wrote me:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ride the old studies with spurs. I don’t like the idea
of your going out to engage in business until you have
gone through Harvard. You will have plenty of time
after you have accomplished this to tackle the world.
Take my advice, my boy, and don’t think of it. A man
without a college education nowadays is badly handicapped.
If he has had the opportunity to go through
college and does not take advantage of it, he goes through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>life with a regret that becomes more intensified as he
gets older. Life is a very serious proposition if we
would live it well.</p></div>

<p>I went through college and I have often
realized since how excellent this advice was,
and marvelled not a little at the many-sidedness
of a frontiersman who could see that particular
situation so clearly.</p>

  <div class="caption">A morning’s bag of prairie chicken in South Dakota<br />
<span class="fs80 fwnormal">Seth Bullock is second from the left, and R. H. Munro Ferguson third</span></div>
</div>

<p>The year before I went with my father to
Africa, R. H. Munro Ferguson and myself
joined the Captain in South Dakota for a
prairie-chicken hunt. We were to shoot in
the vicinity of the Cheyenne Indian reservation,
and the Captain took us through the reservation
to show us how the Indian question was
being handled. The court was excellently run,
but what impressed us most was the judge’s
name, for he was called Judge No Heart.
Some of our hunting companions rejoiced in
equally unusual names. There were Spotted
Rabbit, No Flesh, Yellow Owl, and High
Hawk, not to forget Spotted Horses, whose
prolific wife was known as Mrs. Drops-Two-at-a-Time.
We had with us another man named
Dave Snowball, who looked and talked just
like a Southern darky. As a matter of fact,
he was half negro and half Indian. In the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
days negro slaves not infrequently escaped and
joined the Indians. I went to see Dave’s
father. There was no mistaking him for what
he was, but when I spoke to him he would
answer me in Sioux and the only English words
I could extract from him were “No speak
English.” He may have had some hazy idea
that if he talked English some one would
arrest him and send him back to his old masters,
although they had probably been dead for
thirty or forty years. Possibly living so long
among the Sioux, he had genuinely forgotten
the language of his childhood.</p>

<p>High Hawk and Oliver Black Hawk were
old “hostiles.” So was Red Bear. We came
upon him moving house. The tepee had just
been dismantled, and the support poles were
being secured to a violently objecting pony.
A few weeks later when we were on the train
going East, Frederic Remington joined us.
He was returning from Montana, and upon
hearing that we had been on the Cheyenne
reservation he asked if we had run into old
Red Bear, who had once saved his life. He
told us that many years before he had been
picked up by a party of hostiles, and they had
determined to give him short shrift, when Red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Bear, with whom he had previously struck
a friendship, turned up, and successfully interceded
with his captors. One reminiscence led
to another, and we were soon almost as grateful
to Red Bear for having opened such a
store as Remington had been for having his
life spared. Frederic Remington was a born
raconteur, and pointed his stories with a bluff,
homely philosophy, redolent of the plains and
the sage-brush.</p>

<p>The night before we left the Indians the
Captain called a council. All the old “hostiles”
and many of the younger generation
gathered. The peace-pipes circulated. We
had brought with us from New York a quantity
of German porcelain pipes to trade with
the Indians. Among them was one monster
with a bowl that must have held from an
eighth to a quarter of a pound of tobacco.
The Indians ordinarily smoke “kinnikinick,”
which is chopped-up willow bark. It is mild
and gives a pleasant, aromatic smoke. The
tobacco which we had was a coarse, strong
shag. We filled the huge pipe with it, and,
lighting it, passed it round among the silent,
solemn figures grouped about the fire. The
change was as instantaneous as it was unpremeditated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
The first “brave” drew deeply
and inhaled a few strong puffs; with a choking
splutter he handed the pipe to his nearest
companion. The scene was repeated, and as
each Indian, heedless of the fate of his comrades,
inhaled the smoke of the strong shag, he
would break out coughing, until the pipe had
completed the circuit and the entire group was
coughing in unison. Order was restored and
willow bark substituted for tobacco, with satisfactory
results. Then we each tried our
hand at speaking. One by one the Indians
took up the thread, grunting out their words
between puffs. The firelight rose and fell,
lighting up the shrouded shapes. When my
turn came I spoke through an interpreter.
Coached by the Captain as to what were their
most lamentable failings&mdash;those that most frequently
were the means of his making their
acquaintance&mdash;I gave a learned discourse upon
the evils of rustling ponies, and the pleasant
life that lay before those who abstained from
doing so. Grunts of approval, how sincere I
know not, were the gratifying reply to my
efforts. The powwow broke up with a substantial
feast of barbecued sheep, and next
morning we left our nomadic hosts to continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
their losing fight to maintain their hereditary
form of existence, hemmed in by an ever-encroaching
white man’s civilization.</p>

<p>Near the reservation we came upon two old
outlaw buffaloes, last survivors of the great
herds that not so many years previously had
roamed these plains, providing food and clothing
for the Indians until wiped out by the
ruthless white man. These two bulls, living
on because they were too old and tough for
any one to bother about, were the last survivors
left in freedom. A few days later we
were shown by Scottie Phillips over his herd.
He had many pure breeds but more hybrids,
and the latter looked the healthier. Scottie
had done a valuable work in preserving these
buffalo. He was a squaw-man, and his pleasant
Indian wife gave us excellent buffalo-berry
preserves that she had put up.</p>

<p>Scottie’s ranch typified the end of both
buffalo and Indian. Before a generation is
past the buffalo will survive only in the traces
of it left by crossing with cattle; and the
same fate eventually awaits the Indian. No
matter how wise be the course followed in governing
the remnants of the Indian race, it can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
only be a question of time before their individuality
sinks and they are absorbed.</p>

<p>The spring following this expedition I set
off with father for Africa. The Captain took
a great deal of interest in the plans for the
trip. A week before we sailed he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I send you to-day by American Express the best
gun I know of for you to carry when in Africa. It is a
single action Colts 38 on a heavy frame. It is a business
weapon, always reliable, and will shoot where you hold
it. When loaded, carry it on the safety, or first cock
of the hammer.</p></div>

<p>Seth Bullock was a hero-worshipper and
father was his great hero. It would have
made no difference what father did or said, the
Captain would have been unshakably convinced
without going into the matter at all
that father was justified. There is an old
adage that runs: “Any one can have friends
that stand by him when he’s right; what you
want is friends that stand by you when you’re
wrong.” Seth Bullock, had occasion ever demanded
it, would have been one of the latter.</p>

<p>In the Cuban War he was unable to get into
the Rough Riders, and so joined a cowboy
regiment which was never fortunate enough to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
get over to Cuba, but suffered all its casualties&mdash;and
there were plenty of them&mdash;from typhoid
fever, in a camp somewhere in the South. He
was made a sort of honorary member of the
Rough Riders, and when there were informal
reunions held in Washington he was counted
upon to take part in them. He was a favorite
with every one, from the White House ushers
to the French Ambassador. As an honorary
member of the Tennis Cabinet he was present
at the farewell dinner held in the White House
three days before father left the presidency.
A bronze cougar by Proctor had been selected
as a parting gift, and it was concealed under a
mass of flowers in the centre of the table. The
Captain had been chosen to make the presentation
speech, and when he got up and started
fumbling with flowers to disclose the cougar
father could not make out what had happened.</p>

<p>The Captain, as he said himself, was a poor
hand at saying good-by. He was in New
York shortly before we sailed for Africa, but
wrote: “I must leave here to-day for Sioux
Falls; then again I am a mollycoddle when it
comes to bidding good-by; can always easier
write good-by than speak it.”</p>

<p>His gloomy forebodings about the Brazilian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
trip were well justified. He was writing me to
South America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was glad to hear you will be with your father. I
have been uneasy about this trip of his, but now that
I know you are along I will be better satisfied. I don’t
think much of that country you are to explore as a
health resort, and there are no folks like home folks
when one is sick.</p></div>

<p>The Captain made up his mind that if his
regiment had failed to get into the Cuban
War the same thing would not happen in the
case of another war. In July, 1916, when the
Mexican situation seemed even more acute
than usual, I heard from the Captain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If we have war with Mexico you and I will have to
go. I am daily in receipt of application from the best
riders in the country. Tell the Colonel I have carried
out his plan for the forming of a regiment, and within
fifteen days from getting word from him, will have a
regiment for his division that will meet with his approval.
You are to have a captaincy to start with. I
don’t think Wilson will fight without he is convinced it
will aid in his election. He is like Artemus Ward&mdash;willing
to sacrifice his wife’s relations on the altar of
his country.</p></div>

<p>The Mexican situation continued to drag
along, but we at length entered the European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
war, and for a while it looked as if my father
would be allowed to raise a division and take
it over to the other side. The Captain had
already the nucleus of his regiment, and the
telegrams passed fast and furiously. However,
for reasons best known to the authorities
in Washington, it all turned out to be to
no purpose. The Captain was enraged. He
wrote me out to Mesopotamia, where I was
serving in the British forces:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was very much disgusted with Wilson when he
turned us down. I had a splendid organization twelve
hundred strong, comprising four hundred miners from
the Black Hills Mines, four hundred railroad boys from
the lines of the Chicago and Northwestern, and the
C. B. and Q. in South Dakota, Western Nebraska, and
Wyoming, and four hundred boys from the ranges of
Western South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. It
was the pick of the country. Your troop was especially
good; while locally known as the Deadwood troop, most
of the members were from the country northwest of
Belle Fourche; twenty of your troop were Sioux who
had served on the Indian police. Sixty-five per cent of
the regiment had military training. Damn the dirty
politics that kept us from going. I am busy now locally
with the Red Cross and the Exemption Board of this
county, being chairman of each. We will show the
Democrats that we are thoroughbreds and will do our
bit even if we are compelled to remain at home with
the Democrats.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>After expatiating at some length and with
great wealth of detail as to just what he thought
of the attitude of the administration, the Captain
continued with some characteristic advice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am going to caution you now on being careful when
you are on the firing line. Don’t try for any Victoria
Cross, or lead any forlorn hopes; modern war does not
require these sacrifices, nor are battles won that way
nowadays. I wouldn’t have you fail in any particular
of a brave American soldier, and I know you won’t, but
there is a vast difference between bravery and foolhardiness,
and a man with folks at home is extremely selfish
if unnecessarily foolhardy in the face of danger.</p></div>

<p>All of it very good, sound advice, and just
such as the Captain might have been expected
to give, but the last in the world that any one
would have looked for him to personally follow.</p>

<p>The letter ended with “I think the war will
be over this year. I did want to ride a spotted
cayuse into Berlin, but it don’t look now as if
I would.”</p>

<p>The next time that I heard from the Captain
was some time after I had joined the
American Expeditionary Forces in France. In
characteristic fashion he addressed the letter
merely “Care of General Pershing, France,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
and naturally the letter took three or four
months before it finally reached me. The Captain
had been very ill, but treated the whole
matter as a joke.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have just returned from California, where I was on
the sick list since last December, six months in a hospital
and sanitarium while the doctors were busy with
knives, and nearly took me over the divide. I am
recovering slowly, and hope to last till the Crown Prince
and his murdering progenitor are hung. I was chairman
of the Exemption Board in 1917 and stuck to it
until I was taken ill with grippe, which ended in an
intestinal trouble which required the services of two
surgeons and their willing knives to combat. The folks
came to California after the remains, but when they
arrived they found the remains sitting up and cussing
the Huns.</p>

<p>Now, Kim, take care of yourself; don’t get reckless.
Kill all the Huns you can, but don’t let them have the
satisfaction of getting you.</p></div>

<p>My father’s death was a fearful blow to the
old Captain. Only those who knew him well
realized how hard he was hit. He immediately
set to work to arrange some monument to my
father’s memory. With the native good taste
that ever characterized him, instead of thinking
in terms of statues, he decided that the
dedication of a mountain would be most fitting,
and determined to make the shaft to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
placed upon its summit simple in both form
and inscription. Father was the one honorary
member of the Society of Black Hills Pioneers,
and it was in conjunction with this society
that the Captain arranged that Sheep Mountain,
a few miles away from Deadwood, should
be renamed Mount Roosevelt.</p>

<p>General Wood made the address. A number
of my friends who were there gave me the
latest news of the Captain. He wrote me that
he expected to come East in September; that
he was not feeling very fit, and that he was
glad to have been able to go through with the
dedication of the mountain. He was never a
person to talk about himself, so I have no way
of knowing, other than intuition, but I am
certain that he felt all along that his days were
numbered, and held on mainly in order to
accomplish his purpose of raising the memorial.</p>

<p>I waited until the middle of September and
then wrote to Deadwood to ask the Captain
when he would be coming. I found the reply
in the newspapers a few days later. The Captain
was dead. The gallant old fellow had
crossed the divide that he wrote about, leaving
behind him not merely the sorrow of his friends
but their pride in his memory. Well may we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
feel proud of having been numbered among
the friends of such a thoroughgoing, upstanding
American as Seth Bullock. As long as our
country produces men of such caliber, we may
face the future with a consciousness of our
ability to win through such dark days as may
confront us. The changes and shiftings that
have ever accompanied our growth never found
Seth Bullock at a loss; he was always ready to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Turn a keen, untroubled face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Home to the instant need of things.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Throughout his well-rounded and picturesque
career he coped with the varied problems that
confronted him in that unostentatious and
unruffled way so peculiarly his own, with
which he faced the final and elemental fact of
his recall from service.</p>
